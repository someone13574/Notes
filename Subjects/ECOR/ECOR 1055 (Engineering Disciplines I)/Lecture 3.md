- Dr. Chao Shen
	- Advanced Control & computer vision
	- Autonomous robots technologies

- Robotics
	- Interdisciplinary branch of electronics, communication ,computer science, and engineering. 
	- Involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots.
	- Develops machines than can automate tasks that a human may or may not be able to do.
	- All robots share three traits
		- Some kind of mechanical construction
		- Electrical components
		- Some level of code
	- Systems
		- A combination of components acting together to perform a specific objective
		- Take some input or stimulus, make some output or response
		- Control system
			- Consists of subsystems and processes assembed for the perpose of obtaining a desired output
	- Types of models
		- First-principle
			- Mathemathical
		- Data-driven
			- Empirical
			- Curve fitting
			- Regression
			- Neural networks
