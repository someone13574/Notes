### Objectives

1. Know and under stand the need or computer systems engineering as a discipline.
2. Recall some of history's greatest computer system failures and their causes.

### Computer Systems Engineering

Combines hardware and software to design and implement integrated computer systems for applications in such areas as robotics, artificial intelligence, aerospace and avionic systems, multimedia applications and cloud computing.

- Development
- Testing
- Evaluation
- Integration of both software and hardware

##### System Failures

- Often a consequence of two factors
	1. Increasing system complexity
	2. Failure to use appropriate engineering methods

##### The Importance of Computer Systems Engineering

- They are pervasive in our lives
- They are sometimes critical systems which we rely on for our well being
- We are increasingly relying on advanced software/hardware systems
- Poor engineering practices have lead to catastrophes in the past.
