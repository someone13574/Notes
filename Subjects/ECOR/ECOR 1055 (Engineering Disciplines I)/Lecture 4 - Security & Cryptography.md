---

- Cryptography has been around for a long time (protect info if person is captured)
- Goals
	- Confidentiality
	- Integrity
	- Availability of data (available when needed)
	- Authenticity
	- More...
- Three major players
	- Mathematicians and Cryptographers
	- Cryptographic Engineers
	- Users
- User Perspective
	- Always initiate
	- Protect Email
	- Understand data breaches
	- Use unique passwords
	- Use password manager
- Developer's Perspective
	- Example: Design a program which can accept 8-bytes of user input and compares it against an 8-byte stored value
		- Theoretical security: $18.4 \times 10^{18}$ possible values.
		- If a computer can check 1 million per second, it takes 584,542 years to finish testing all cases.
		- Decent security assuming there is no way to reverse the stored value
		- Possible methods
			- Just compare the bytes
				- Very bad security
				- Password is found if database is breached
				- Early return can be used to determine each bit one by one if response time is measurable.
