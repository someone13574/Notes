- Radians
	- A radian is a measure of a central angle theta that intercepts arc s equal in length to the radius r of the circle.
	- To convert degrees to radians, multiply by $\frac{\pi}{180}$
	- To convert radians to degrees, multiply by $\frac{180}{\pi}$.
- Sinusoids
	- A sinusoid is a signal that has the form of the sine or cosine function
	- A general expression for the sinusoid is $v(t) = V_msin(\omega t + \Phi)$ 
		- $V_m$ = Amplitude in V or A
		- $f$ = frequency in hertz
		- $\omega = 2\pi f$ = Angular frequency in radians/s
		- $T = \frac{1}{f}$ = Signal period
		- $p$ = Phase (degrees or radians)
	- Example
		- Given $5sin(4\pi t - 60^o)$, calculate amplitude, phase, angular frequency, period, and frequency
		- Amplitude $V_m = 5$
		- Phase $p = -60^o$
		- Angular frequency $\omega = 4\pi$
		- Frequency $f = 2$
		- Period $T = \frac{1}{2}s$
- Complex Numbers ("Tash Numbers")
	- More convenient to work with complex numbers
	- Dealt with similar to vector in mechanics
	- $\sqrt{-1} = j$
	- Rectangular representation
		- $z = x + jy = r(cos\ p + j\ sin\ p)$ 
		- Normal coordinates
	- Polar representation
		- $Z = r \angle p$
		- Magnitude and angle
		- Magnitude from $r=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ 
		- Angle from $p = tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})$ 
		- Multiplication
			- $x_1x_2 = r_1r_2 \angle (p_1 + p_2)$
- Resistance
	- The friction against the flow of current
	- It is present in all conductors. Most notable in resistors
	- Symbol is R
	- Measure is ohms
	- Frequency independent
- Reactance
	- The inertia against the flows of currents
	- Present anywhere electric or magnetic fields are developed in proportion to an applied alternating voltage or current
	- It is present in capacitors and inductors.
	- Frequency **dependent**
	- Symbolized with X and measured in ohms
- Impedance Z
	- Comprehensive expressions of all forms of opposition to current flow
		- Resistance and reactance
	- Present in all circuits and components
	- Complex quantity which may be expressed as $Z = R jX$ (rectangular form)
	- Measured in ohms
	- Magnitude is $Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2}$
	- Can be combined using the same rules developed for resistors
		- Add parallel
		- Reciprocals of equivalent is equal to sum of reciprocals.
	- Ohm's law holds for impedance
		- $V = IZ$
	- KVL and KCL hold for impedance
- Capacitors
	- Passive element
	- Stores energy in its electric field
	- Consists of two conducting plates separated by an insulator
	- Capacitance C is the ratio of the charge q on a capacitor to the voltage difference v between the two plates, measured in farads (F)
	- $q = C \times v$
	- **Acts as an open circuit at DC (0hz) and a short circuit at very high-frequencies ($\infty$)**
	- Each plate holds an electrical charge, one positive and the other negative
	- Ideal capacitors do not dissipate energy. Only storing and supplying.
	- Impedance of capacitor:
		- $Z_C = \frac{1}{j\omega C}$ 
		- $Z_C = \frac{-j}{\omega C}$ (multiplied by $\frac{j}{j}$ using $j^2 = -1$)
		- $Z_C$ = $-jX_C$ 
		- Where $X_C = \frac{1}{\omega C}$ is reactance
- Inductors
	- Passive element designed to store energy in its magnetic field
	- Consists of a coil of conducting wire
	- Uses inductance to oppose the charge of current flowing through it measured in Henry (H)
	- Acts as a short circuit for DC (0Hz), and an open circuit for high frequencies ($infty$)
		- Opposite of capacitors
	- When current flows, it creates a magnetic field
	- Does not dissipate energy
	- "If you touch a microwave's capacitor, it will cause the current to flow through you and you will not be able to submit your lab because you are dead."
	- The impedance is
		- $Z_L = j\omega L$
		- $Z_L = jX_L$ 
		- Where $X_L = \omega L$ is the reactance of the inductor
