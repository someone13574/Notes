- Marrette contectors are for high voltage wires
- A.W.G = American wire guage
	- Higher the wire guage, the lower the current
- Heat shrink: Just used to make things neater
- Boards:
	- Solderless breadboard
	- Stripboard
	- Printed Circuit Board
- Soldering
	- Process in which two or more metal items are joined by metling the flowing a filler metal into the join
- Input devices
	- A hardware or peripheral device used to send data to a computer
- Output devices
	- A device used to send data from a computer to another device
- I/O devices: Sensors
	- Mechanically
		- Position
		- Distance
		- Stress
		- Acceleration
		- Rotation
	- Environment
		- Temperature
		- Humidity
		- Pressure
		- Light
		- Sound
