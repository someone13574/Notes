- Sensors
	- Used for detecting physical parameters
	- Examples
		- Proximity sensors
		- Accelerators
		- Thermometers
		- Pressure sensors
	- Used to provide data to the control system for real-time decision-making
	- Use electrical signals like voltage or current to describe signals from the physical world.
- Control Systems
	- Control engineering
		- Deals with the design and implementation of control systems during linear, time-invariant mathematical models.
		- It is a challenge to create simple, yet reliable and accurate mathematical models
	- There are open and closed loop feedback control systems
	- A control system is an interconnection of components form a system configuration that will provide a desired system response
		- A sensor is a device that provides a measurement of an external signal
		- An actuator is a device employed by the control system to alter or adjust the environment.
	- Open-Loop control
		- Takes an input and creates an output
		- No sensor
		- Is simpler and cheaper
		- Possibly inaccurate
		- Poor flexibility
		- Example: microwave
	- Closed-Loop control
		- Uses sensors to measure error between target and reality
		- Controller uses actuators to adjust environment to minimize error
		- Advantages
			- Accuracy
			- Adaptiablity
			- Stability
			- Improved performance
			- Ability to reject external disturbances
		- Disadvantages
			- Complex
			- More expensive
			- Slower response
