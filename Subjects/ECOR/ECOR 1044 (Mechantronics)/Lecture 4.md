- Digital
	- Discrete/finite
	- Limited set of values which can be represented
	- Better precision and robustness from noise
	- Higher latency
	- Higher power consumption greater complexity
	- Easier to reprogram and reconfigure
	- Better long-term storage
- Analog
	- Continuous
	- Exposed to noise and signal degradation
	- Precision is limited and quality of components
	- Small variations in the signal can lead to inaccuracies
	- Infinite resolution
	- Smoother and faster real-time responses
- Hybrid
	- Uses both analog and digital components
- Binary
	- Number system wth only two digits: 0 and 1
		- Also known as Base-2
	- Foundation of digital computing isnce it maps easily onto two states: on (1) and off (0).
	- Beyond 1, we 'carry' the 1 to the left and reset the symbol to the right of 0, resulting in 10 (two).
	- Each 1 or 0 is a bit
	- 4 bits is a nibble
	- 8 bits is a byte

- Logic gates
	- Not
		- Inverts a bit
		- x with bar on top
		- 0 -> 1
		- 1 -> 0
	- And
		- Outputs 1 if both inputs are 1
		- ab or $a \cdot b$ 
		- 0 0 -> 0
		- 0 1 -> 0
		- 1 0 -> 0
		- 1 1 -> 1
	- Or
		- Outputs 1 if either input is 1
		- a + b
		- 0 0 -> 0
		- 0 1 -> 1
		- 1 0 -> 1
		- 1 1 -> 1
	- XOR
		- a (+) b
		- Returns if exactly one of a or b is 1
		- 0 0 -> 0
		- 0 1 -> 1
		- 1 0 -> 1
		- 1 1 -> 0
