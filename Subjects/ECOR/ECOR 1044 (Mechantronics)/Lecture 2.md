- Digital vs. Analog
	- Digital is discrete and bounded
	- Analog is continuous and unbounded
	- Analog is impacted by noise
	- Digital is more flexible, cheaper, smaller, and more efficient
	- Increasingly cheaper, smaller, more efficient
- Microprocessor (CPU)
	- Defined typically as a single processor cor ethat supports at least instruction fetching, decoding, and executing.
	- Normally can be used for general purpose computing, but needs to be supported with memory, input and output.
- Microcontroller (MCU)
	- Typically has a single rocessor core
	- Has memory blocks, digital and anolog io, and other peripherals
	- Typically used for basic control purposes, such as embedded applications
	- Typically programmed in assembly or low-level languages such as C.
		- Assembly gives more control, but is less portable.
- Simple loop vs RTOS
	- ISR: Inter-service routing
	- Simple loops allow a single program to run
	- RTOS allows multiple programs to run in parallel
