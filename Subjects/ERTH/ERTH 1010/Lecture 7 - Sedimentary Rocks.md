		- 2-64 mm
			- Pebbles
		- 00625-2 mm
			- Sand
		- 0.002-0.0625 mm
			- Silt
		-  <= 0.002
			- Clay
	- Our categories
		- > 2 mm
			- Gravel
		- 0.06-2 mm
			- Sand
		- < 0.06 mm
			- Mud
	- Gravel
		- Angular = breccia
		- Rounded = Congloerate
		- Finer-grained matrix
			- Sand or mud matrix in between pieces
	- Sand
		- Called sandstone if mostly make of sand
		- If rock feels gritty on teeth, it is sand
			- You can also rub between fingers
				- Smooth is mud
			- Most sandstone is quartz sandstone
			- Arkose is feldspar-rich sandstone
	- Mud
		- Shale
			- Horizontal cleavage
		- Mudstone
		- Either term is acceptable
	- Types
		- Breccia
		- Conglomerate
		- Sandstone
		- Shale or mudstone
	- Clastic Rock Properties
		- Grain size
		- Roundness
			- Smooth vs sharp edges
			- Tells distance travelled
		- Sorting
			- Distribution of grain sizes in rock
			- Same size indicates long distance travelled
			- Finer grains can travel further causing separation
		- Mineral Composition
			- What is it made of it
			- How tough is it
				- Physical and chemical
			- Quartz and feldspar are dominant due to toughness
				- Framework silicates are tough physically
				- Feldspar breaks down faster due to poor chemical resistance
				- Low temperature rocks
			- Olivine, pyroxene, hornblende, micas are poorly resistant
				- High temperature rocks
		- Abrasion dictates grain size, roundness, sorting
			- Close to source
				- Large, Angular clasts, poorly sorted
			- Far from source
				- Smaller grains, more rounded clasts, better sorted.
	- Maturity
		- Mature
			- Well sorted
			- Find-grained
			- Rounded
			- Mostly quartz
			- Far traveled
		- Immature
			- Poorly sorted
			- Coarse
			- Angular
			- Little quartz
			- Close to source
	- Examples
		- Conglomerate
			- Large and small particles
			- Somewhat rounded
			- Poorly sorted
			- Little quartz
			- Immature
		- Quartz Sandstone
			- All sand-sized
			- All rounded
			- Well sorted
			- 99% quartz
			- Mature



- Sedimentary Structures
	- Deposited in layers
		- Beds
		- Strata
		- Each layer is unique
			- Records conditions under which particles were deposited
			- Boundaries are when sediment is eroded
			- Each event could be days, years, or million of years
	- Conditions of layers recorded in sedimentary structures
	- Lots of time record is missing due to erosion
	- Cross-bedding
		- Sand dunes
		- River deposites
		- Records alternating wind or current direction
		- Particles are eroded from leading edge of dune and deposited on tailing side
			- Perpendicular motion to dune
		- Top is cut off by advance of dune
	- Ripples
		- Mostly form in water
		- Eg. On breach
		- Symmetric indicates bidirectional motion from waves
		- Asymmetric indicates uni-directional motion from stream or river current
			- Longer going up, fast going down
			- Smaller scale cross-bed
	- Mud cracks
		- Muddy sediment dies, skrinks, and cracks
		- Cracks can be filled with another sediment
		- Only forms in dry environments with shallow water which dries
	- Fossils
		- Remains of organism
			- Type of organism can indicate environment
		- Only show dead organisms
		- Shells, bones, petrified word, imprints of plants
		- Trace fossils
			- Burrows, trails, footprints
	- Fithification
		- Transformation of sediment into sedimentary rock
			- As sediment is compacted, water moves up and out
			- Edges of grains desolve into remaining as they are squeezed together
			- Desolved mineral precipitates as cement around grains
				- Cement can be silica, carbonate (common in oceanic settings), or iron oxide
				- Acid will desolve carbonate *cement*. Grains will remain
				- Iron oxide cement makes red sandstone



### Chemical Sedimentary Rocks

- Material precipitated from water
	- Mostly minerals
- Two types
	- Inorganic
		- Crystallised from supersaturated water
	- Organic
		- Organisms extract compounds from seawater to form shell
		- Dies and sinks to bottom
		- Compressed and turned into rocks
		- Not made of minerals due to being biological but still a rock

- Inorganic
	- Silica
		- Chert
		- Opal
			- Has water
		- Microcrystalline
		- Deposited in cavities in rocks
			- Creates geodes
			- Water sits in middle and forms quartz crystals
		- Colors
			- Come from inpurities carried in the water
			- Red-brown = jasper
			- Grey = flint
			- Banded = agate
	- Calcium carbonate or silica
		- Preciptates inorganically at hot springs
			- Travertine (CaCO3) or sinter (silica)
		- Cold water: stalactites or stalagmites
		- Limestone
			- Ooids
				- Require warm water
					- CaCO3 desolves in cold water
				- Calcium carbonate precipitates around sand grain cores or anything round
	- Evaporites
		- Precipitate due to evaporation of shallow lakes, inland seas
		- Precipitate in order of increasing solubility
			- Ca, SO4: Gypsum
			- Na, Cl: Halite
			- K, Cl: Sylvite
				- Tastes bad
		- Playa lakes
		- Creates salt flats
			- Perfectly flat
- Organic
	- Ca, CO2: limestone
		- Most common chemical sediment
		- Contain fossils
		- Coral reefs are preserved as limestone and create oil reservoir rock
	- SiO2
		- Microfossils create chalk
			- The chalk is different from chalk used on blackboard
		- Plankton die and are deposited on the sea floor
