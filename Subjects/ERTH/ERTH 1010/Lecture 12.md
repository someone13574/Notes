- Gravity review
	- g is a function of R and Mass
	- Gravimeters are used to measure gravity
		- Units are milligals
		- 10 km change in crustal thickness is ~20 mgal
	- Corrections must be made to make measurements useful
		- Free air corrects for elevation
		- Bouguer correct sfor mass of column beneath station to sea level
		- $g_B = g_{obs} - g_{\lambda} + FAC - BC$ 
	- Gravity anomalies
		- Excess mass = positie
		- Deficiency of mass = negative
	- Isostacy: thick mountain belts underlain by low-density roots
- Learning outcomes
	- Understand the theory of isostacy
		- Crust floats on mantle
	- Pratt vs. Airy models of isostacy
	- Understand how Bouguer anomalies indicate state of isostatic equilibrium
	- Understand the effects of glacial ice on the crust
	- Understand why geology can be a major influence on damage due to natural hazards
- Airy Conclusion
	- Mountain underlain by deep, low-density root
	- Displaces high density mantle
	- Was the first formulation of the principle of isostacy
		- Large crustal masses that extend high above sea level are compensated by underlying low-density masses
	- Airy model
		- Consider blocks of wood floating in water
		- Wood floats because it is less dense that water
			- Thicker blocks protrude higher, but also extend deeper
		- Submerged part is its root
		- Results in deeper root of less dense material in addition to higher height
	- Isostacy Reality
		- Crust blocks exert weight on underlying mantle
		- This causes the mantle to flow over a long time scale
		- Crust floats on mantle
		- Depth to which flow in mantle occurs is called compensation depth
		- At this depth and pressure, all columns are equal
		- Only occurs when all movements has stopped.
	- Airy model problem
		- Assumes all blocks have the same density
	- Pratt Isostacy Model
		- Proposed model where wood blocks have different densities
		- Lower density blocks on inside
		- Dense rocks on outside
		- Low density blocks float higher than denser blocks
		- Achieves equilibrium through lateral variation in density.
		- Pratt's is flat and Airy's varies
