- Learning Outcomes
	- Understand concepts of stress and strain and what is the elastic modulus
	- Know how elastic, viscous, and plastic materials behave under stress
	- Know what geologic structures are produced in deformed rocks: Folds, Faults, Joints, Foliation, and Lineation
	- Understanding the concept of strike and dip, plunge
	- Understand the surface rock patterns formed by folding rocks
- Plate driving forces
	- Plates move at constant rate
	- Inbalance: dense rocks over less dense rocks
- Ridge Push
		- Oceanic crust is ~7 km thick
		- Layer which forms is originally just crust
		- Gravity pulls lithosphere down on either side of the ridge, moves sideways
		- Analogy
			- Tobogganer is the lithosphere and crust
			- Asthenosphere is the fill
			- Gravity pulls the tobogganer down the hill and pushes sideways
			- Don't need to know the force of ridge push
	- Slab pull
		- Mineral reactions make slab denser
			- Formation of garnet
		- Pulls rest of plate once subduction starts to occur
		- Don't need to know force
		- ~5 times stronger
	- Slab pull is dominates
		- Once subduction starts, it dominates

- Final exam: Permanent deformation of a material occurs at its: Elastic limit


- Features
	- Folds
	- Faults
	- Joints
	- Foliation
	- Lineation
	- Rock fabric is sum of all features above

- Antiforms and synforms are general forms
	- Anticlines and synclines are very specific
		- Anticlines has the added requirement what in the middle must be the oldest
	- An antiform with youngest rocks in the core is an antiformal syncline
		- This fold sequence has been overturned
