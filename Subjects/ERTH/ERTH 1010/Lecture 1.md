# Learning Objectives

## The Solar System and Geologic Time

### Chapters 1, 23, 8 of the textbook

- Understand the processes by which the solar system, Earth, and Moon formed
- Know what are meteorites, and what they tell us about our solar system 
- Know how we measure the age of rocks, and know the major events that occurred during the first billion years of Earth existence.
	- Most of the rocks from the first billion years have been destroyed by Earth processes and thus we need to use other techniques to understand major events.

## The Universe

-  Big Bang Theory: universe formed ~14 billion years ago, expanding (red shift, longer l)
- Initial gas clouds 1H only, then fusion --> 4He 
- Condensation of clouds --> first stars (H + He only) 
- Within stars, fusion --> heavier elements (up to 56 Fe)

## Origin of Heavier Elements

Stars run out of H --> death, compaction --> increase in temperature explosion: supernova Creates heavier elements (greater than Fe), scattered throughout space, incorporated as DUST in gas clouds --> new stars.

## Our Solar System: Nebular Hypothesis

Formed 5.5-4.6 billion years ago (Ga) from initially cold gas and dust cloud. 

- Matter concentrated at the core --> Sun
- Smaller masses --> Protoplanets
- Protoplanets merge to form planets
- Process accumulation termed *accretion*
- Solar wind (radiation) drive gases and light elements from inner planets --> rocky bodies.
- Outer planets retain original gaseous composition

## Accretion and Differentiation of Earth

Earth began as a mass of accreted material, but is now split into core, mantle, crust. This is called *differentiation*.
