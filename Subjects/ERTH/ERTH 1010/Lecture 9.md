- Earthquakes
	- Movement of the Earth along breaks in crust
	- Breaks in crust called faults
	- Motion on faults is called displacement
	- Motion on fault releases energy and creates seismic waves
- Elastic Rebound Theory
	- Friction along fault
	- Rocks bend, store elastic strain energy
	- Eventually friction exceeded
	- Rocks on either side snap back.
- Hypocentre/focus: Point from which the earthquake begins
	- Energy radiates outward
	- Mostly shallow (< 15 km depth) due to any deeper being too hot
		- Exception is subduction zones
- Epicentre: the point on the Earth's surface over the hypocentre
- Seismic waves
	- Like any other wave
		- Has amplitude and wavelength
		- Frequency is measured in waves per second
- Earthquakes mostly appear on edges of plates
	- Most are around the Pacific Ocean making the Pacific Ring of Fire.
	- Also in middle of oceans at divergent places
	- Middle east has lots of side interactions
- Measuring Earthquakes
	- Zhang Heng
		- Inventor of the Eastern Han Dragon Seismoscope
			- Dragons holding falls over frogs
			- Which dragons drop the ball indicate the direction of the wave
	- Seismometer
		- Anchored to bedrock
			- Soil dissipates energy
		- Tall support is connected via a spring and hing to a suspended mass.
		- Pen on suspended mass enscribes movement onto rotating drum.
		- Different variants for vertical/horizontal
		- Movement in pen indicates energy
		- Most are all electronics now
			- Doesn't use pens and weights
	- Until the 1930's, only data on earthquake intensities based on subjective reports shaking, damage
	- Mercalli scale
	- Richter Scale
		- Developped in 1935
		- Based on amplitude of seismograph
		- Called Richter Magnitude Scale
		- Related to energy released during earthquake
		- $M = log_{10}Amplitude + constant$
		- Constant corrects for distance from epicentre
		- Magnitudes
			- M = 1-3
				- Recorded on local seismographs but not generally felt
			- M = 3-4
				- Often felt, no damage
			- M = 5
				- Felt widely, sight damage near epicentre
			- M=6
				- Damage to pooly constructed buildings and other structures within 10's km
			- M = 7
				- "Major" earthquake, causes serious damage up to ~100 Turkey, Kobe
				- T
			- M = 8
				- "Great" quake
				- Loss of life over several 100 km
				- 1906 San Francisco
			- M = 9
				- Rare "great" earthquake
				- Major damage over a large region over 1000 km
				- Chile 1960, Alaska 1964
				- Japan 2011
				- West coast North America 1700
		- Each unit increase is a ten-fold increase in amplitude
			- Ten-fold increase is amplitude equals 32-fold increase in energy
			- A M6.5 quake is ~1000 times more energetic than M4.5
- Gutenberg-Richter Magnitude-Frequency Plot
	- Frequency of earthquakes on y axis
	- Magnitude on x axis
	- Lots of little earthquakes
	- Very few large earthquakes
- How do the Mercalli and Richter scales differ
	- The Mercalli scale is based on damage reported
	- The Richter scale is based on the measured amplitude of the seismic waves.
- Fault Rupture Length
	- Bigger earthquakes break longer sections of fault
- Types of Seismic Waves
	- Seismographs record arrival time and size of seismic waves
	- Surface waves
		- Travel along the Earth's surface
		- Can be vertical or horizontal
		- Forms when body waves return to the surface from depth
	- Body waves
		- Travel through subsurface
		- P: Compressional waves (primary wave)
		- S: Shear waves (secondary/shear wave)
	- Order
		- P arrives first with lowest amplitude
		- S waves arrive slower, higher amplitude
		- Surface waves are the slowest and have the highest amplitde
	- Speed
		- The speed of a wave is given by $\sqrt{elastic moduls / density}$
		- Density is constant but EM changes
		- P waves ~ 1.7 times faster than S waves
		- Surface waves = 0.9 times S waves
		- This can be used to find location using three stations and triangulation
