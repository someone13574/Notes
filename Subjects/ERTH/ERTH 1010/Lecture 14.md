- Learning outcomes
	- Know the difference between geographic and magnetic North and South Poles
	- Know that Earth’s magnetic field has two components – dipole (bar magnet) and non-dipole field
	- Understand declination vs. inclination
	- Know that rock magnetism lost above the Curie Point (temperature)
	- Understand that field is due to convection in the core 
	- Understand that the field reverses polarity on average every 0.5 Ma 
	- Understand that paleomagnetism (magnetic inclination) tracks the latitude where continents were in the past
- The magnetic field
	- Earth's magnetic field result from the internal properties of the planet
	- Protects the planet from solar radiation
	- Helpful for navigation
	- William Gilbert proposed that the Earth was a large bar magnet
- Magnetic vs. Geographic North
	- Geographic North
		- Where the spin axis is in the northern hemisphere
		- North pole is 90 degrees N latitude
		- This is constant
	- Magnetic north
		- The direction the compass points, not constant
	- Declination
		- Angle between magnetic and geographic North
- Orientation of the field
	- Field lines go from the south pole to the north pole
	- The field is parallel to the surface at the equator
	- The field is perpendicular to the surface at the poles
	- Inclination
		- Angle between horizontal and the orientation of the field lines
- Where does the magnetic field come from
	- Comes from inside of the Earth
	- Magnetic rocks heated to greater than 570 degrees C makes it non-magnetic
		- Curie Point
		- Property of all magnetic minerals
	- Therefore molten or hot rocks cannot be magnetic
	- All rocks deeper than 25 km are above Curie Point
	- **Geodynamo**
		- A moving electrical conductor in a magnetic field generates a current
		- This current then generates a magnetic field
		- Earth has a natural dynamo
			- The outer core of conductive liquid Ni-Fe alloy convecting due to heat loss
		- Analogy
			- A magnetic field runs through a spinning disk
			- This generates current
			- The current runs through a coil
			- This generates a magnetic field
			- This generates more current
			- Etc.
		- We have not firm understanding of the geodynamo
