### Chapters 23, 8

---

### Summary

- Solar System forms from nebular cloud, termed Nebular Hypothesis
- Planets form by accretion of metallic, rocky fragments between 5.5 and 4.6 Ga (giga-annum)
- Earth, other planets differentiate into core + mantle (silicate minerals; rock) 
- Moon forms due to collision with Mars-size body; only silicate material ejected

> All bodies in the solar system initially had the same composition.
- We can test this by comparing the compositions of the sun (solar abundances), chondritic meteorites (C1 meteorites)
	- C1 meteorites contain droplets of the original solar system elements.
	- Light elements such as N, C, O, and H are different.
	- Lithium was not produced.

### Types of Meteorites

- **Chrondritic**: fragments of undifferentiated solar system material
- **Stony**: rocky portions of differentiated planetary bodies
- **Irons**: fragments of metallic cores of differentiated planetary bodies
	- The major iron in the core is iron, followed by nickel. Any metal can be present. Uranium can also be included, as it can act as a metal or rock.
- **Stony-irons**: both rocky and metallic portions.

### The Moon

- Covered by regolith (debris from impacts)
- Split into the highlands (bright part)
	- Anorthosite (feldspar)
	- Lots of impacts
	- Formed from floating scum
	- Older (4.5 billions years old)
- ..and the lunar Maria
	- Younger (3.8 - 3.2 billions years old)
	- Filled by lava flows 

> *Why does the Earth not look like the moon?*

- Mars' low density is due to a smaller metallic core

# The Planets

### Mercury

- Innermost
- 2nd smallest
- Heavily cratered highlands
- No atmosphere
- 1 day = 176 Eath days
- Temperature extremes:
	- Night = -170 C
	- Day = 427 C

### Venus

- Atmosphere is 97% CO2. Shrouded in clouds
- Temperature up to 475 C. Runaway greenhouse effect.
- Similar surface
- Low crater density, abundant recent volcanism, faults. 10 km high mountain ranges.
- Mantle convection
	- No plate tectonics for 0.5 billion years.
- Stopped behaving like Earth 0.5 billions years ago.

### Mars

- Atmosphere:
	- $CO_2$
	- Trace amounts of water
	- 1% density of Earth
- Polar icecaps
	- South: $CO_2$
	- North $H_2O$ with layer of $CO_2$
- Rocky surface with sand dunes
- Massive volcanoes
	- Interior was much hotter earlier in history which allowed for larger volcanoes.
- Deep valleys from running water, lakes, slumps due to ice melting in soil.
- Two moons which are captured asteroids
	- Irregularly shaped.
- Geologically quiet for billions of years

### Jupiter

- Mass 2.5 times combined mass of all other planets
- Atmosphere made of H, He, CH$, NH3, H20, S. Stormy.
- Bands driven by internal heat loss (convection).
- Liquid H exists at depths > 1000 km.
- May have rocky or metallic core
- 4 largest moons are larger than our Moon.
	- The innermost moon, Io, is volcanic.
		- Caused by gravitation pull of Jupiter.
		- Deformation keeps the interior hot.

### Saturn, Uranus, Neptune

- Gaseous with atmospheres made mostly of H, He, CH4
- Uranus and Neptune lock NH3

### Pluto (Drawf Planet)

- 30-50% ice, 50-70% rock
- Rotation axis tilted
- Atmosphere 99.7% N2, trace CH4.
- "Moon" (satellite) Charon, synchronous orbit and tidally locked.
	- Two new "moons", Nix and Hydra discovered in 2005.

# Early Earth

- After the Moon formed, the Earth was differentiated and mostly molten
- "scum" at the surface was Earth's first crust.
- The crust was very unstable.
	- The material underneath it was very hot.
		- From the core, radioactive decay.
	- The Earth is still cooling today.
- The crust
	- "oceanic" crust with basalt, solidified from melting of the mantle.
	- Floating parts would sink back until lava.
- There were not continents 4.5 billion years ago.
	- Today 30% of the surface is continents.
		- The ocean floor is mostly not continents.
	- How and when did continents form?
	- Geo-chronology - Chapter 8.

## Geochronology

![[Pasted image 20240910170327.png]]

- **Radiometric Dating**: Decay of one isotope to another
	Depends on the time and the parent daughter ratio.
- Must also date a mineral that is resistant to diffision of isotopes.
	- ZrSiO4 (ZIRCON) is the best.
		- Very common in the contential crust.
		- Formula not needed.
		- Takes lots of uranium, no lead

##### Calculating (Formula not needed)
![[Pasted image 20240910170720.png]] 

Maximum of six half-lives due to too little parent atoms left.

### Instruments

- Mass spectrometer
	- Extract out parent and daughter elements
	- Look at ratio to determine age
- Blasting Zircon with laser before use in mass spectrometer
	- Can also use chemistry for more accuracy.
