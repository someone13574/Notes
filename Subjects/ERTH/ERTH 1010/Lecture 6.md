## Bowen's Reaction Series

- Interested in order of what minerals crystallise as temperature decreases.
- Two series
	- Discontinuous series
		- Starts at 1250 c, ends at 750
		- Starts as olivine
		- Joined with pyroxene
		- Olivine stops
		- Joined by aphibole
		- Pyroxene
		- Joined by biotite
	- Continuous series
		- Sodium rich at low temperatures
		- Calcium rich at high temperatures
- High temperature is ultramafic, low temperature is felsic
	- Ultramafic
	- Mafic
	- Intermediate
	- Felsic
- Something is missing
	- Pyroxene is very different from amphibole
	- There is no water in pyroxene, there is water in aphibole and biotite
- Summary
	- High temp
		- Olivine, pyroxene, Ca-feldspar
	- Intermediate temp
		- Amphibole, Na-feldspar, biotite
	- Low temp
		- Biotite, N-K feldspar, quartz
	- The most complex minerals crystallise at low temperatures
		- Ca-feldspar is the exception, it is a framework silicate
		- At lower temps the atoms are less agitated and thus can bond easier

## Plutonic Igneous Activity

- Vast majority of magmas solidify at depth (87%)
- To see these rocks the covering rocks must be eroded first
	- Pluton
		- large, massive intrusion
	- Sill, Dyke
		- thin, tabular intrusions
		- Sheets
		- Sills tend to be horizontal
			- Follows zone of weakness
		- Dykes tend to be vertical
		- Dykes can range from centimetres to kilometres in width
	- Batholith
		- Group of plutons
			- Similar age
		- Represented uplifted eroded roots of subduction-related volcanic complexes
	- Neck
		- Solidified dyke within a volcano
		- Devils tower in Wyoming

## Types of Volcanoes

- Shield volcano
	- Fluid lavas lead to broad low slopes
	- Creates streaks in ground from flows
	- Look like a shield that has been flipped upwards
	- Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea are some of that tallest volcanoes in the world. Even taller if you measure from the base of the seafloor.
- Composite Volcano
	- Also called a stratovolcano
	- Make of alternating lauers of lava flows and pyroclastic materials
		- Lava is from passive eruptions
		- Pyroclastic material is from explosive eruptions
	- Steep slopes
	- Tall
	- Snow-capped
		- Can melt to create mudflows and avalanches
	- Pyroclastic flows can surmount obstacles. Hills will not stop.
- Cinder cone
	- Built of basaltic pyroclasts
		- Scoria
	- Steep slopes
		- As steep as gravity allows
	- Small size
	- Crater in centre
	- Often has lava flow from base of cone
	- Formed from lava blobs being blown into the air, cooling, falling down into cone shape.
	- Each one has an individual dyke
	- Lava jets can be *very* tall, Puu O' O' was over 300m.
	- Sulfur clouds
- Lava Dome
	- Highly viscous magmas
	- Flow very slow
		- Cm per day
		- (Shield volanoes can move kms per hour)
	- Forms steep-sided lava domes, or thick localized flows
	- Edges are loose blocks
	- Core of volcano creates lobes which pushes a carapace of broken up blocks
		- Core is lava
		- Exterior is rubble
	- Felsic
- Caldera
	- Collapse structure from large eruption of stratovolcano (composite volcano)
	- Created by magma body beneath volcano being erupted in a short about of time
	- Creates void space which collapses.
	- Ex. Crater Lake
	- Later magmas erupt and partially fill caldera
	- Mt. Saint Helane is not a caldera
		- Most material was moved down the mountain
		- Other material was blown into the air
		- Not much fell into the base
		- Not large enough

## Volcanic Products

- Lavas
	- Basalts
		- Pahoehoe
			- Smooth, glassy surface
			- High temperature (metres per minute)
		- A' a'
			- Hurts to walk over
			- Sharp
			- Glassy
			- Dense liquid core
			- Solid top and bottom
			- Moves slowly (metres per hour)
		- Pillow lavas
			- Form because water cools edges of lava flow
			- Edge is solid, centre is liquid
			- Edges crack and form new pillow lavas
	- Andesite Lavas
		- More viscous
		- Flow slower
		- Make thicker flows than basalts
			- 10's of metres trick
		- Don't travel as far as basalt
	- Rhyolive Lavas
		- Don't flow far
		- Subby flows or domes
		- Rubbly flow surface and flow front
		- High silica content'
		- Very viscous
- Pyroclastic materials
	- Pumice or scoria
		- Lumps of frothy magma
		- Silica rich
		- Pumice
			- Few cm's (~fist sized)
			- Highly vesiculated
			- Glassy
			- Very felsic
			- Floats in water
		- Scoria
			- Vesicular basalt
			- Not glassy
			- Forms cinder cones
			- Dark color
			- Doesn't float on water
	- Ash, dusts
		- Fine particles
		- Can be easily into atmosphere
			- Effects climate
		- < 2 mm
		- Can cause lots of damage
			- Thickly accumulates
			- Heavy
			- Collapses buildings
	- Bombs
		- Large ejected lava blobs
			- Centre can still be liquid
		- Aerodynamic shape
			- Shaped like bomb, falls like bomb
		- Tail can fall off
		- Not pre-existing in volcano, from lava
	- Blocks
		- Ejected solid, pre-existing rock
		- Already solidified
			- From previous activity
		- Do not want to be near, can land km's away
	- Pyroclastic Flows
		- Hot (>800c)
		- Mix of hot gases, ash and pumice
		- Moves very quickly (cannot out drive)
			- Accelerates down slope
			- Starts slowing once off of slope
		- Fluid
			- Can go over and around obstacles
		- Commonly from collapse of the eruption column
			- Eruption column is material blown into air
		- Creates layered deposits
			- Layers are divided into ash, pumice, and rock fragments
			- Can have larger fragments with the flow
			- Newer flows can cut into older flows
				- Digs into ground
- Gases
	- Cannot see gas products which may have hazards
	- H2O
	- CO2
		- Colourless
		- Tasteless
		- Heavier than air
	- SO2
- Mudflows, lahars
	- Melting of snow mixes with ash
		- Creates mudflow
	- Called lahar when hot
		- Water can be ~150c
	- Can move buildings
	- Consistency of concrete
