## Metamorphism

- New minerals formed
	- Old ones not stable at new temp and pressure
	- Chemically active fluids (H2O, CO2)
- New textures
	- Arrangement of minerals in rock
- Types
	- Contact metamorphism
		- Cooling pluton releases heat into surrounding rocks
		- Increase in temperature causes recrystallization
		- Metamorphic aureole
		- Rock name = hornfels
			- Rings when struck with hammer
		- Examples
			- Lava flowed over mudstone
				- Makes baked mudstone
			- Still of basalt going through limestone
				- Creates layer of marble.
				- Grain sized increased from original limestone
	- Regional metamorphism
		- Increase in temperature and pressure due to burial
		- Grade of metamorphism is determined by depth
			- Close to surface is sedimentary
			- Low, medium, and high grade
			- If temperature increases too much at a given depth, the rock is not metamorphic, it is igneous (partially melt)
			- Low temps for a given temp are never realized on earth
		- Grades
			- Low grade
				- Rock get harder
				- More compact (interlocking crystals, parallel)
				- Minor increase in grain size
			- Medium grade
				- Grain size increases
				- New mica crystals form
			- High grade
				- Grains recrystallize with preferred orientation
				- Orientation = foliation
				- Not all metamorphic rocks are foliated
					- Sandstone to quartzite: grains only grow
			- Foliated rocks in increasing grade
				- Slate: planar cleavage, fine-grain
				- Phyllite: cleavage, rock "sheen"
				- Schist: large micas, platy look
				- Gneiss: layered, often folded
					- "Nice"
					- Gneissic banding quartz & feldspar, hornblende/amphibole & mica
				- Migmatite: partially melted
					- Contains pockets of igneous rocks
					- On boundary of high-grade and igneous
					- Ribbons of quartz and K-feldspar (melt) in biotite and hornblende matrix
					- Looks like gneiss except melt ribbons crosscut foliation
					- Quartz and K-feldspar euhedral
						- Coarse-grain
						- IGNEOUS
			- Non-foliated
				- Quartzite: metamorphic sandstone
					- Sandstones doesn't have much other than quartz
					- Cannot make new minerals, there is only quartz
					- Can only reshape quartz
				- Marble: metamorphic limestone
					- Coarse grains of calcite
				- Amphibolite: metamorphic basalt
					- Medium grade
				- Eclogite: metamorphic basalt
					- High pressure (not high temperature) (low T high P)
					- High-grade
					- Green pyroxene
					- Red garnets.
					- Very recognizable.
		- Location
			- Typically occures in continent-continent collisions
				- Crust may be doubled in thickness
				- Continent tries to go down, cut cannot due to low density
				- They lock up
				- Crustal rocks go to deep depth.
			- Ordering
				- Mountains
				- Folder, unmetamorphosed sedimentary rock
				- Slate
				- Phyllite
				- Mica schist
				- Garnet-mica schist
				- Gneiss
				- Migmatite
			- Low T, high P
				- Along the wavy line (never realized boundary)
				- Only occurs during subduction of oceanic lithospheric late
				- The plate is cold and slow to heat by conduction
				- Plunges quickly to great depth and pressure
				- Examples
					- Glaucophane amphibole is blue and very diagnostic
					- Eclogites: green matrix with red garnet
				- Very rare but very diagnostic of origin
	- Metasomatism
		- Interaction between hot fluids and rocks
		- Fluids released from cooling plutons
		- Heat from cooling pluton can cause convection of groundwater already in the rock to circulate
		- Fluids have dissolved ions that react with rocks
		- Examples
			- Limestone -> skarn
			- Basalt -> greenstone
		- Minerals
			- Porphyroblasts
				- Large
				- Euhedral crystals
					- Euhedral means crystal faces are perfectly developed
				- Grew in solid state
					- In igneous rocks crystals are formed from a melt
				- Garnet
				- Andalusite
				- Staurolite
				- Chloritoid
- Index Minerals
	- Certain minerals form only under particular P-T conditions: index minerals
	- Can use index minerals to determine P and T of metamorphism of rock
	- 1 Gpa = 10 kbars ~= 30 km
	- Minerals with the same composition but different crystal structures can be very different.
		- Can tell depth of rocks
