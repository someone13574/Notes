- Review
	- Earthquakes
		- Release of energy along faults
	- Elastic Rebound Theory
		- Rocks in upper parts of Earth behave elastically and will build up strain until it breaks
	- Hypocentre
		- At depth (< 15 km)
	- Epicentre
		- Projection at surface
	- Seismometers
		- Records amplitude and time
	- Magnitude
		- Mercalli Modified Intensity Scale
			- Subjective report of damage
		- Richter Scale
			- Based on energy and amplitude
	- P, S, and surface waves
	- Epicentre location by triangulation.
- Learning outcomes
	- Forceshocks and aftershocks
		- How they defined fault plane
	- Stress, strain, and elastic modulus
	- S saves to no pass through liquids
	- Wave refraction and reflection's utility in describing Earth's internal structure
	- Mantle tomography
- Foreshocks and Aftershocks
	- Main earthquake can be preceeded and followed by many smaller earthquakes
	- Foreshocks not common. Seen in some large earthquakes
	- Afterchocks common
		- Dangerous due to people thinking event is over and more weakened buildings collapsed
		- Movement of crustal material in fault area that restributes stress after main earthquake
		- Rocks on either side of the fault moved in main even, still not stable
		- Defines fault plane
			- We can map in 3d
- Properties of Rocks That Influence Seismic Waves
	- Temperature
		- Higher temp slows waves
	- Pressure
		- Higher pressure speeds waves up
	- Density
		- As density increases speed increases
		- Product of temperature, pressure, and composition
			- As temperature increases, density drops
			- Increasing temp with depth makes rocks more dense
			- Rocks at depth compressed by overlying rocks, increases density with depth
			- *Pressure is more important than depth*
	- Elasticity vs. plasticity
		- Elastic
			- Returns to original shape after deformation
			- Unless you exceed strength of material
		- Plastic
			- Retains new shape after deformation
		- Rocks at Earth's surface are elastic
			- Stretch, return to orginal shape
			- Can also break to form faults
		- Rocks at depth are plastic
			- Deform so there are no quakes
	- Stress vs. strain (elastic modulus)
		- Stress = force applied
			- Force per unit area applied to object
			- Pull = tension
				- Rocks tend to break under tension
			- Squeeze = compression
				- Rocks stronger under compression
			- Twist = shear
		- Strain = way rock responds
			- Change in volume or shape as result of applied stress
			- Expressed as $(V_{new} - V_{orig}) / V_{orig}$
			- Elastic Modulus
				- Stress / Strain
				- Two types: shear modulus and bulk modulus (compression)
				- Both increase with increasing pressure and decrease with temperature
				- Liquids deform permanently when sheared, shear modulus is 0
					- Gases as well
					- S Waves Do Not Travel Through Liquids
						- Since they move by shear movement, liquids stop them
- Waves can be modelled as rays or wavefronts
- Velocity can be measured as distance/time if travel path is straight and the material is homogeneous.
	- Seismic velocity increases with depth due to pressure
	- Causes rays to curve away from core.
	- Waves also refract due to changes in materials
	- Some is also reflected by layers with higher density
	- Can be used to determine crustal structure
		- Trucks create vibration
		- Placed seismograph stations measure direct wave, reflected waves, and refracted waves.
- Crust
	- Heterogeneous in composition and structure
		- Numbers are averages
		- P-Waves
		- Crust: $V_P ~ 6 km/s$ (Cont)
			- Up to 70 km thick
		- Ocean crust: $V_P 7 km/s$ 
			- Very constant
			- ~7 km thick
		- Mantle: $V_P = 8 km/sec$
		- Crust-mantle boundary called the "Moho"
	- Any change in material will cause energy to be reflected back to surface
		- Companies may look for salt because oil pools where salt is
		- Can find groundwater using same technique
- Mantle
	- Low-velocity zone at 100-300 km depth. 1% melt
	- P, S wave velocities increase through mantle
	- Phase transitions at 410 km and 660 km (olivine) as mantle minerals which to denser lattices
- Core
	- P-waves entering core half in speed
	- S-waves die
	- P-waves gradually increase until inner core, then jump in speed
	- S-waves are made from p-waves in inner core
- Shadow zone
	- 103-142 for p-waves (refraction through core)
	- >103 for s-waves (blocked through core)
		- Outer core must be liquid
