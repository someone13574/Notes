- Review
	- Catastrophism
		- Earth is only 6000 years old
		- Everything has to happen fast
	- Uniformitarianism
		- Everything has to happen slow
	- Wegener and continential Drift
		- 5 pieces of evidence
		- Wasn't accepted
			- Didn't have driving force
	- Post-WW11 Seafloor spreadinging
		- Both oceans *and* continents moving
- Learning outocmes
	- Know evidence suporting three kinds of plate boundaries
		- Divergent
		- Convergent
		- Transform
	- Understand processes that occur at plate boundaries
	- Know the structure of lithospheric plates
		- Mantle, crust
		- Move over asthenosphere
- Convergent Margins
	- If new crust is being created, old crust must be destroyed to keep surface area constant
	- After WW2
		- Lithosphere is recycled into mantle at convergent margins by subduction
		- Oceanic lithosphere gets older, colder, and denser with time
			- Eventually sinks
	- Three types of Convergence
		- Convergence of two oceanic plates
			- Subducting slab
			- Creates deep see trenches
				- Partially filled by sediment
			- Creates accretionary prism
				- Some sediment from volcanic arc
			- Water moves upward and causes mantle to melt
				- Creates volcanic arc
		- Convergence of oceanic and continential plates
			- "Andean"
			- Still has accretionary prism
			- Water thickens creates magma
				- Cannot penetrate continental crust
				- Melts crust, assimilates
			- Explosive eruptions
		- Continental-continental convergence
			- Low-density material does not want to subduct
			- Crustal material tends to get scaped up and added to the other plate
				- Nearly doubles thickness of the crust
			- Lithospheric mantle still subducts due to being denser
				- Crust still gets scaped off
			- No melting of the mantle
				- No water
	- Evidence for subduction
		- Saw earthquakes in mantle
			- Mantle cannot have earthquakes due to being brittle
			- Brittle rocks must be descending into the mantle
		- Lithospheric plate remains cooler than mantle around it
		- Mantle tomography shows fast (cold, dense) zone that corresonds with the same area as the earthquakes
			- Shows cold layer of material near plate boundaries
			- Can be tracked all the way to core-mantle boundary
		- Bouguer gravity is negative due to plate bending downwards, pushing asthenosphere down
			- Replaced with *seawater*
			- ~Normal heatflow
		- Gravity is high where plate is doubled (fore arc)
			- Very low heatflow due to two plates
		- Volcanic arc
			- Very high heatflow
			- Melting of mantle, magmas
			- ~Normal gravity
				- Slightly lower due to slightly thinner plate
					- Continues into back-arc
		- Magmatic arc
			- Plate is too thick to cause decompression melting
			- Real cause: water is released which lowers melting point
- Transform margins
	- In diagrams, bulging plate is overriding
	- The section between the two spreading centers the plates are travelling in different directions
		- This creates earthquakes
	- Beyond that point, they travel in the same direction
		- No earthquakes
		- Still a fault, they are still separated
		- "Fracture zone"
	- Difference in age in transform fault and fracture zone since plates across the fracture were formed from different spreading zones at different times
	- Mendocino Fracture zone can be tracked all the way across the pacific
	- Depth changes as square-root of age
		- Different sides of the fracture can have very different depths

- What are the important differences between Wegeners Theory of Continental Drift and the modern Theory of Plate Tectonics
	- Plate tectonics has a driving force
	- Plate tectonics has the whole plate moving, not just continents

- Geologists today have a tool for restructing paleogeography which Wegener did not have
	- Climatic indicators
	- Paleomagnetism*******
	- Rock type similarities
	- Fossils
	- Detailed coastal maps

- Gabbro is mafic plutonic
- Lithosphere is *very* thick under archean crust

- Motion on a sphere
	- Angular velocity is constant across the whole plate
		- Actual velocity increases as you get further away from the pole
		- Max velocity is at $90\degree$ from pole of rotation
	- Pole of rotation is not the same as the earth's spin axis
- Kansas has no deformation due to being in the middle of the north american plate in the middle of a craton
