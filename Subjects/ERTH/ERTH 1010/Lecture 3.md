### Eons

- Hadean (4.55 - 4.0 Ga)
- Archean (4.0 - 2.5 Ga)
- Proterozoic (2.5 - 0.57 Ga)
- Phanerozoic (0.57 Ga - now)

## Accretion

- Moving plates carry small fragments of continental material that collide with, and are thus added to, older continental masses.
- Central parts are old while surrounding parts are younger.
- Continents split as well.
	- This is where incoming mass comes from.
- Plates are like conveyor belts
	- The end is the a plate.
	- Terran is carried on the conveyor plate
	- The Terran is becomes combined together up again the plate.
- Orogens: Growth by addition of small continental masses along margins of cratons.
- Appalachian mountains were from collision is Africa.
- West coast is "Cordillera"

### The Three Atmospheres

1. H, He
2. Swept away by solar wind
3. Volcanism created the second atmosphere, H2O, CO2, H, S
4. The Earth cooled enough that H2O pools ormed, so H2O was removed
5. CO2 was removed by photosynthesis and carbonate rocks
6. Now N and O dominated atmosphere (from organic activity)
7. No free O2 for the first 2.5 billion years of Earth's history due to reaction with iron

### Quiz Question 1

As the Earth Differentiated, <u>iron and nickel</u> sank to the core.

1. Water
2. Volcanic rocks
3. Iron and nickel
4. Silicon

### Summary

- Earth formed 4.6 Ga
- Moon formed at 4.5
- Continent formation at 4.4 Ga
	- We know because of Zircon
	- Water was also around this time
- Major continent formation during Archean
	- Growth continued after due to collision and volcanism

## Plate Tectonics

- Lithospheric Plates
	- Earth has ~13
	- Include mantle and crust
- Plate: crust plus uppermost mantle (solid)
	- In motion relative to the core and mantle
	- Roughly 120 km thick
	- Moves due to convection
		- Plates absorb energy, core releases
			- Heat can flow up through weaker parts easier
- Plate Boundaries
	- Divergent
		- Forms new plate
		- Example: Africa and South America separating two form the Atlantic
		- Forms ocean floor which is made from upper mantle
	- Convergent
		- One plate moves back into the mantle
		- Melts
		- Creates a series of volcano due two lower plate melting
	- Transform
		- Two plates sliding past each other
		- Example: Queen Charlotte Fault and North American plate
		- Creates lots of Earth quakes
- Asthenosphere
	- Hot, plastic, convection

## Minerals

- Must be naturally occurring
- Must be inorganic
	- Not inorganic chemically, made in an inorganic process 
- Must be a homogeneous solid
- Must be an ordered atomic arrangement (crystal structure)
- Must have a fixed chemical composition
- There are around 4000 minerals
	- There are only 25 we need to know
- Examples of materials which are not minerals
	- Bone (organic)
	- Seashell (organic)
	- Opal (not a crystal)
		- Quartz is the same composition but has a crystalline structure
	- Tree resin (organic)
	- Volcanic glass (not fixed composition, not a crystal)
- Mineral properties reflect bond type and strength
	- Ionic bonding
		- Halite - NaCl
		- Donate / stealing electrons to make both more stable
	- Covalent 
		- Graphite or Diamond (C)
		- Sharing electrons
	- Van der Waals
		- Weak attractions between layers of bound atoms
	- The arrangement of atoms in a lattice impacts properties as well
		- Creates gaps for smaller atoms in between
		- Minerals with the same composition with different arrangements can have very different names and properties
	- Mineral Groups
		- Silicate \[SiO4\]4O-
		- Oxides \[O2-\]
		- Sulfides \[S2-\]
		- Sulfates \[So4\]2-
		- Halides \[Cl, F\]1-
		- Carbonates \[CO3\]2-
		- Hydroxides \[OH\]1-
		- Phosphates \[PO4\]3-
		- Native element (Copper, gold)

### Silicate Minerals

- Basic Unit: Silica tetrahedron 
### $[Si^{4+}O^{2-}_4]^{4-}$

- Five Silicate Mineral Groups
	1. Isolated tetrahedra
	2. Single chain
	3. Double chain
	4. 2-dimensional sheet
	5. 3-dimensional framework

##### Isolated Tetrahedra

- Held individual tetrahedra together by bonds with Fe and Mg cations
	- Four available O's for bonding
- Olvine: primary mineral in Earth's mantle (65%)
	- (Mg, Fe)2 SiO4
	- Magnesium is generally more common
	- Can be any proportions

##### Single Chains: Pyroxens

- Mg-Fe series (orthopyroxene)
	- Rectangular structure
- Ca-Mg-Fe series (clinopyroxene)
	- Sheer structure
- Form the rest of Earth's mantle

#### Double Chains: Amphiboles

- Compositionally diverse
	- Ca-Mg-Fe elements from single chains, as well as a few more
		- Other elements can go in the holes of the lattice
	- Mg, Fe, Ca, Na, K, OH-
- Two single chains linked by two oxygen

##### 2-Dimensions Sheet Silicates

- Mica
- Linked double chains
- Big atoms can fit in the holes

##### Framework Silicates

- Complex structures
- Three-dimensional
- Quartz
- Feldspars
	- Ca-Na-K substitution in lattice

### Quiz Question 2

- Inoganic
- Crystal lattice
- homogenous / fixed composition
- Naturally occuring
- Solid

## Mineral Properties

1. Lustre
	- Way light is reflected from the surfice

- Habit: Shape
- Cleavage: The way it breaks
- Fracture: The way it breaks without any weak spots
