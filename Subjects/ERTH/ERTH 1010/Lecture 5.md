### The Crust

- Primarily silicate minerals
- Two types
	- Oceanic: olivine, pyroxene, Ca-feldspar
		- Doesn't float as high
	- Continental: feldspar, aphilibole, mica, quartz
		- Floats more
		- More complicated silicate structure

### The Feldspars

- Three varities
	- Plargioclase feldspar (calcium rich)
		- Occur in Mg-Fe-rich SiO2-poor rocks with olivine, pyroxene
		- Simple structures
	- Albite (Sodium rich)
		- Occurs in rocks with intermediate SiO2 contents with pyroxne, amphibole, or biotite (rare).
	- Potassium feldspar (potassium rich)
		- Crystallizes at the lowest temperature
		- Occurs in high SiO2 content rocks with mica, amphibole, and quartz.

### The Rock Cycle

- Types of rocks
	- Igneous
	- Sedimentary
	- Metamorphic
	- Igneous + metamorphic = 95% of rocks at the surface
						- ![[Pasted image 20240919162036.png]]
- Igneous Rocks
	- Crystallise from magma
	- Types
		- Extrusive: volcanic (surface)
			- From lava
			- Make way from where they melt to surface
			- Cools quickly at surface
				- Few lays
				- Small grain size
				- Possible to have two phases of cooling
					- One at depth, one at surface
					- Both big and small crystals.
		- Intrusive: plutonic (at depth)
			- From magma
			- Magmas which intrude the crust and freeze before making to surface to form volcanic feature.
			- Most magmas don't reach the surface.
			- Cool slowly at depth
				- Millions of years
				- Causes uniformly large grain size
		- ![[Pasted image 20240919171144.png]]
	- Volcanic materials
		- lava flows, domes
			- Domes are thick so it doesn't flow and instead forms a dome.
			- Water vs. Peanut butter.
			- Low SiO2 lava + hot (~1150 C) = flow
			- High SiO2 lava + not as hot (~900 C) = dome
				- Magma = beneath surface
				- Lava = at surface
		- Pyroclastic: ash, cinders, bombs
			- Explosive
		- Gases: H2O, CO2, SO2
			- Dangerous and difficult to see coming.
			- Never be down wind of the summit.
	- Places which melt
		- Between mantle and asthenosphere
			- 50-70 km
		- Collisions of crust
			- Rare
			- Specific conditions
			- Thick crust
	- The mantle is not made of a single component
		- The different components have different melting temperatures
		- Multi-mineralic
		- Partial melt
			- Always a solid left behind
			- 5%-15% will melt typically
			- ![[Pasted image 20240919163939.png]]
			- The mantle will not melt under normal conditions
				- First condition which causes melting:
					- Decompression melting
					- Mantle rises vertically, crosses solidus, partially melts
					- Lowers pressure, temperature stays the same
					- Occurs when two plates diverge
					- Forms new crust when plates diverge
				- Second condition
					- Dehydration melting
						- This is called **de**hydaration because the a plate going down absorbs water and then the plate is dehydrated. The mantle is hydration.
					- Adds water to H2O
						- This breaks down silica bonds
						- Makes it easier to turn solid to liquid
					- Lowers solidus temperature
					- Partially melts
				- Third condition
					- Hotspots
						- Different from decompression because decompression is mantle moving up.This is from the D''
					- Mantle which is anomalously hot which gives enough heat to melt
					- D'' is the zone between the outer core and the lower mantle
						- ~150 km thick
					- Hot spots are the plumes at the boundaries of convection
					- Diaperes == mantle plumes
				- Forth condition
					- Melting of subducting plate is very rare
					- What is really happening water is coming off the plate and lowering melting point of mantle

### Naming Rocks

- Minerals
- Texture
- Chemical composition
	- Linked to minerals
- Mafic
	- Ma: Magnesium
	- Fi: Iron
- Felsic
	- Fel: Feldspar
	- Si: Silica (quartz)
- Textures
	- Glassy: no crystals visible
	- Aphanitic: crystals present, need hands lens
		- Opposite of Phaneritic
	- Phaneritic: all crystals easily seen with eye
		- Opposite of Aphanitic
	- Porphyritic: mix of small (matrix) and coarse (phenocrystas) crystals
		- Matrix cooled quickly
		- Phenocrysts cooled slow at depth
	- Vesicular: Bubble holes
		- From gases
		- Sign that rock was volatile rich
