- Learning Outcomes
	- Know that heat has external and internal sources
	- Internal
		- Primordial
		- Radioactivity
	- Understand  three mechanisms of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and advection
	- Understand geothermal gradients and how to calculate one
	- Understand that the ocean floor deepens and the lithosphere thickens away from diverent margins due to heat loss
	- Know that the seafloor hydrothermal vents and onland hotsprings result in rapid crustal cooling
- Heat is a critical factor for life on Earth
- 2 sources of heat
	- Sun (radiated back to space)
	- Earth interior (slowly released to space)
- Heat drives processes
	- Both external and internal heat are critical to geology
	- External heat drives climate, rainfall, weathering, erosion (surface processes).
		- Keeps temperature at 15-20c. Stable water in three forms.
	- Internal heat drive igneous activity, metamorphism, and plate tectonics.
	- Earth inherited its internal heat
- Earth's Internal Heat
	- Primordial heat
		- From accretion, core formation, collision event, meteorite bombardment
		- No more energy input after ~4.4 Ga.
		- If primordial heat was the only source of heat, Earth would have cooled to the point where plate tectonics stop.
	- Heat from Radioactivity
		- Decay of instable isotopes
		- Decay of a nucleus releases energy and radiation
		- This energy is converted to heat
		- More heat is in the crust per volume
			- These elements prefer to be in melts rather than in mineral lattices in the mantle
			- Termed incompatible elements
			- Even though more heat comes from the crust per volume, the mantle is much larger
- Temperature Drop with Time
	- Time time, the concentration of radioactive elements decrease, causing heat production to decrease with time
	- $T_{mantle}$ only dropped since 4.4 Ga, yet 75% of primordial heat is lost
		- Radioactivity is key to keeping the mantle hot
- Heat Flow
	- Movement of heat through the Earth
	- Three mechanisms
		- Conduction: transfer at atomic or molecular level in material
		- Convection: transfer as molecules move from one place to another in material
		- Advection: uplift of rocks carries heat up with them
			- Only really important in mountain belts
			- Continent-continent collisions
	- Heat flow through different materials
		- Lithosphere: conductive heat transfer
			- Rate at which heat moves from the mantle to the surface if the Earth.
			- Heat, flex, heat geberat
		- Mantle, outer core: high viscosity fluids, convective heat transfer
			- Very slow
		- Moving away from the mid-ocean ridge results in a deeper depth
			- Cools, contracts, increases in density
			- Sinks into asthenosphere
			- Ocean depths increase as lithosphere gets older moving away from mid-ocean ridge
			- $d = 2.5 + 0.35\sqrt{t}$
				- Where $t$ is age in millions of years
				- $d$ is depth in km of ocean floor.
			- Oceanic lithosphere thickens with age
				- As lithosphere moves away from ridge, asthenosphere freezes onto lithosphere.
- Hydrothermal vents
	- First discovered in 1977 in the Galapagos
	- Theorized due to lots of water, near to surface magma, volcanic rock which water can move through
	- Represent major process of heat loss: convective
	- Release dissolved metals into oceanic water
	- Biota are based on sulphur as an energy source, not photosynthesis.
		- Possible origin of life on Earth ~4 billion years ago.
