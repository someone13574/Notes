### Moh's Hardness Scale

- Measured by indentation force
- Exponenential
- Can use different materials to test easily
	- Fingernail: 2.5
	- Copper coin: 3
	- Knife: 5
	- Steel file: 7

### Improved Way To Remember (PC)

- The (talc)
- Geologist (gypsum)
- Can (calcite)
- Find (florite)
- An (apatite)
- Ore (orthoclase feldspar)
- Quickly (quartz)
- Through (topaz)
- Correct (corundum)
- Data (diamond)

### Properties

- Specific gravity
	- Weight of mineral relative to weight of equal volume of water.
	- Silicates: 2.5-3.3
	- Gold: 15
- Colour
	- Useful for some minerals, usually not very helpful
	- Sulfur is bright yellow
	- Azurite is a very specific colors
	- Quartz: orange/brown, purple, brown/black, rose, transparent.
		- Not very helpful.
- Streak
	- Color of the powder
	- Non-metallic: white
	- Metallic minerals: varies, but helpful
		- Hematite: red
		- Geothite: brown
- Habit
	- Crystal form
	- Slow growth along growth faces
		- Each face grows outward at specific speed
	- Must grow slowly for good crystal faces
		- Quartz: hexagonal, pyramidal termination
		- Galena: Cubes
			- Usually bright gray
			- Heavy
		- Sulfur: Four sided barrels with pyramidal terminations
- Cleavage
	- The breakage surfaces
	- Planes of weakness in the lattice
	- Galena: cubic cleavage
		- Most minerals don't break into same shape as their habit
	- Amphibole: prismatic cleavage.
		- Most minerals are prismatic cleavage
	- Prismatic cleavage
		- Breaks along two planes
		- Angle between planes can be used to tell minerals apart.
- Fracture
	- Irregular breakage in minerals without planar weakness
	- Example: Quartz is a network silicate which has curved breaks
		- Also creates small curved lines on the surface called conchoidal fracture.
		- Obsidian also has conchoidal fracture
- Twinning
	- Polysynthetic Twins
		- Imagin a lattice is growing to the right and up
		- At some point the lattice with change to grow to bottom right
		- Creates kinks in the mineral
	- Growth/penetration twins:
		- Two crysals which grow into each other at different angles which causes them to share a lattice.
			- Ex. Staurolite (doesn't need to be 90o)
		- Since if is difficult to get the atoms together for a new nucleus it is efficient for multiple minerals to grow from the same nucleus
- Matnetism
- Taste
- Soapy feel
- Greasy feel
- Reaction with acid
- Perthitic texture

### Non-silicate Minerals
- Oxides
	- Heratite
	- Magnetite
- Carbonates
	- Reverse soluability (forms in *warm* water)
	- Calcite (CaCO3)
	- Dolomite (Mg, Ca) (CO3)
- Sulfides
	- Galena: Lead sulfide
	- Usually for from heat below made by magma and water is heated. Rocks precipitate from water due to heat to form sulfides
- Sulfates andHalides
	- Typically form together
	- Form in desert environments
	- Halite (table salt), Gypsum
	- Minerals precipitate in the summer
	- In the winter storms wash minerals from surrounding hills into a very thin lake.
		- Playa lakes.
		- The thin lake must be thin enough to create a high enough concentration to precipitate.
  - Native Elements
	  - Example: Sulfur

## Mineral Occurrences on Earth

- Earth is chemically zoned
	- Core
	- Mantle
	- Crust
- The Core
	- Outer core: molten, no minerals
	- Inner Core: solid mineral structures unknown
- The mantle
	- Mostly Mg-Fe silicates
	- Upper mantle: olivine, pyroxen
	- Lower mantle: pyroxen, garnet, perovkite
