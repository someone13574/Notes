- Learning outcomes
	- Gravity Varies on Earth
		- Elevation, Density
	- Gravity surverys require corrections for latitude, elevation, surface rock density
	- Free Air and Bouguer anomalies
	- Thin lithosphere has negatibe Bouguer anomaly, thick lithosphere positive
	- Understand how Bouguers anomaies are used to hunt for petroleum-mineral deposits
	- Why are continents above sear level
	- Why is the oceanic crust submerged
	- Why do some plateaus sit several km above sea level when average elevtion is 1 km.
- Newton and the Laws of Gravity
	- Any two masses exert an attractive force between them
	- $F_g \approx \frac{M_1 \times m_2}{r^2}$ 
	- On Earth, this force is NOT constant; function of r and rock density.
	- Your weight varies depending on where you are
		- Equator: 175 lbs
		- North Pole: 176 lbs
		- Mt. Everest: 174.9 lbs
	- Why?
		- r is lower at the pole than at the Equator (Earth isn't a sphere), whereas r is higher on Mt. Everest than at sea level.
			- g is lower at higher r
- Gravimeters
	- Arm is held by spring
	- Gravity pulls down
- Variations in g
	- Variations in g expressed in milligals (mgal)
	- 1 gal = $0.01 m/s^2 = 1 cm/^2$ 
	- 1 mgal = $10^{-5} m/s^2$  (about 1 millionth of g)
- Typical Variations
	- Sedimentary rocks are 10 mgal lower than igneous
	- Every 10 km change in crustal thickness is $\approx 20 mgal$ 
	- Every 100 km change in thickness of lithosphere is $\approx 200 \text{ mgal}$

- Most of inland is low g because crustal rocks are low density compared to oceanic crust


- Pull of Gravity
	- At any point on Earth
		- $F_g = m \times g (g = \text{acceleration of gravity})$ 
		- ON AVERAGE, $g = 9.81 m/s^2$ 
		- 9.78 at equator, 9.832 at poles

- Simpilfied example: Gravity Survery
	- Uniform rock density, constant r
	- Goal: find metalic ore; dense, strong g
	- This is complicated in reality
- Better Example:
	- There are two effects
		- Topography (r)
		- Density (m)
	- Useful Gravity Maps
		- Depend on corrections made to observed g along survey points
		- Goal is to elimate variations due to height r and surface geology
		- Corrections
			- Latitude $\lambda$:  Earth oblate spheriod; correct to Equator
				- $g_\lambda = 978031.85 (1.0 + 0.005278895 sin^2(lat) + 0.000023462 sin^4(lat)) (mGal)$ 
				- $g_\lambda$ increases from zero at Equator to maximum at Poles as $r$ decreases, so *subtract* from $g_{obs}$, thus corrects to value at Equator.
					- $g_{corr} = g_{obs} - g_\lambda$ 
			- Elevation r: correct to constant elevation; correct to sea level
				- $g_F = g_{obs} - g_{lamdba} + \delta g_f$ 
				- Sea level is a good reference since it pulls water to a constant level
				- Ignores anything between sea level and point. Thus "Free air"
				- $\delta g_F = -\frac{2g}{R} \times h$ 
				- Sea Surface Gravity
					- Sea surface undulates due to topography on sea floor
					- Sea surface rises over submarine volcanoes and ridges due to excess pull of gravity on water
					- Only a few cm/mm
					- Over trenches, sea surface drops due to deficiency in gravity
					- Geoid defines surface where gravity is always perpendicular to sea surface
			- Density variations: correct for $p$ in rocks at Earth surface
				- Bouguer density
				- Requires geology info at surface
					- Result: investigates density variations at depth
				- $g_B = g_{obs} + \delta g_F - \Delta g_B$ 
				- $\Delta g_B \approx G \rho h$ 
					- $g_B$ = Bouguer Anomaly
					- $\Delta g_B$ = Bouguer correction
					- G = constant of gravitation $6.67 \times 10^{-11} \frac{N \cdot m^2}{kg^2}$ 
					- $\rho$ = density of rock
					- h = height about reference level (sea level)
					- Typical correction: -42 mgal per km height

- Free Air over mountains in Americas are smaller than expected
- Isostacy
	- Sir George Airy during Great land Survery of India
	- One thing you need to know up and down
	- Handing mass is used
	- If a mountain belt was to side, angle would change (very small)
		- Smaller than expected, meaning there is less excess mass
		- Initial assumption: crust-mantle boundary is flat, so no effect of mantle on gravity
		- Reality: As crust thickens, it grows down as well. Low-density crust root pushes down high-density mantle
		- Principle of Isostacy
			- Large crustal masses that extend high above sea level are compensated by underlying low-density masses
			- Like iceberg
				- Ice is less dense than water
				- Floats on water but still displaces it.
