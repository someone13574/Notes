- Orbital Overlap Model
	- Assumption: Only the valence orbitals are needed to describe bonding
	- ![[Pasted image 20241002091159.png]]
	- Predicts 90 degrees for H2S. Closer to experimental (92) than Vespr (109.5)
- Methane
	- Maximum 2 e or per orbital
	- Based on overlap modle, carbon should only be able to form 2 bonds
	- VSPER theory tells us that there are 4 C-H bonds.
	- Must modify the theory of bonding
- Hybridization/Hybrid Orbital Theory
	- Hybrid atomic orbitals: one "s" and 3 "p" orbitals combine to varying proportions to form hybrid orbitals (sp, sp2, and sp3 orbitals)
	- num of hybrid orbitals generated by hybridication = num of valence atomic orbitals participating in hybridization
	- Experimental evidance points to 4 identical bonds in methane
	- Methane forms from orbital overlap between the hydrogen 1s orbitals and the sp3 hybrid orbitals of the carbon atom
	- Steric number of an inner atom determines the number and type of hybrid orbitals
		- 2 = linear = sp
		- 3 = trigonal planar = sp2
		- 4 = tetrahedral = sp3
		- 5 = trigonal bipyramidal = sp3d
		- 6 = octahedral = sp3d2
	- They form localized bonds by overlap with atomic orbitals or with other hybrid orbitals
	- No need to hybridize outer atom orbitals because they do not have limiting geometeries
- Bonds
	- Sigma: end to end
	- Pi: formed by p orbitals and has high electron density above and below the bond axis
	- Single bond: sigma bond
	- Double bond: sigma bond and pi bond
	- Triple bond: sigma bond and two pi bonds
- Molecular Orbital Theory
	- Involes delocalized electrons
	- Orbital: region in space where the probabiltity of finding an electron is high
	- Orbitals are described mathematically as wave functions
	- Orbitals are described mathematically as wave functions
	- Bonds are formed by the overlap of atomic or hybrid atomic orbitals
	- Atomic orbitals and/or hybrid atomic orbitals overlap to form molecular orbitals
		- Single bonds: $\sigma, \sigma*$
		- To form double and triple bonds: $\pi\ and\ \pi*$
	- Orbitals have positive and negative phases (like wave)
		- Positive phases constructively overlap, form $\sigma$
		- Positive and negative phases destructively overlap, form nodal plane ($\sigma*$ )
	- Drawing
