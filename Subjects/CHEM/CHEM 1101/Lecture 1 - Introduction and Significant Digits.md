### Central Learning Outcomes

- **Sustainable development goals**
	- 17 goals made by the United Nations for sustainable development by 2030. Many of these rely on chemistry.
	- Chemists and engineers make the world more sustainable.
- **Green chemistry**
	- The design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances.
	- Applies across the life cycle of a chemical product including its design, manufacture, use, and disposal.
- Learning outcomes:
	- Apply core chemical concepts and processes to solving complex problems.
	- Describing macroscopic properties of substances.
	- Constructing scientific arguments.
		- The "why" or to justify your response.
	- Applying green chemistry concepts.

### Significant digits

- Used to rewrite numbers which are too precise so that they are easier to work with without losing too much precision.
- Significand = the non-zero portion of the value
- Exponent = the power of ten you have to multiply the sigificand by to give the true magnitude of the value.
- Speed of light in a vacuum: 299 800 000 m/s
	- $c = 2.998 \times 10^{10}$
- Useful for very large and small numbers.
- Useful for rounding numbers.

##### Accurate vs. Precise

- Accurate: Centred around target
- Precise: Very detailed, maybe not correct.
- Accurate & Precise: Very detailed and close to target.

##### Measurements

For a thermometer scale with marks for the 0.1 decimals, it would have a plus or minus of 0.02.

- Eg: $32.33 \pm 0.02$.

##### Rules
- 2.25: All non-zero numbers are significant
- 2.405: Zeros between non-zeros are significant
- 2.4050: Zeros to the right of the decimal point are significant
- 2400: Zeros with no decimal point are NOT significant
- 0.00034: Leading zeros are NOT significant
	- Becomes: $2.40 * 10^{-4}$

##### Calculation Rules

- Addition & Subtraction:
	- Count sigfigs relative to the decimal point
	- Use the minimum amount
	- $52.012\text{mg} + 751\text{mg} = 803\text{mg}$
- Multiplication & Division:
	- Use the minimum number of sigfigs
	- $152m \times 2 s^{-1} = 304 m/s$
- In Scientific Notation
	1. Add them in a calculator
	2. Convert all of the values into the same exponent as the exponent in the answer you get.
-  Always carry through one or two extra significant digits
	-  Round at the end
- Round up if the first digit to be eliminated is a 5 or higher
- Round down if the first digit eliminated is less than 5

A 100 mL volumetric flask is guaranteed to contain the specified volume to within 0.1 mL. 

It has four significant digits.

The result of $(3.8621 \times 1.5630) - 5.98$ is properly written as $0.06$ (a).

This is because the subtraction only has two decimal points, so the answer has two as well.
