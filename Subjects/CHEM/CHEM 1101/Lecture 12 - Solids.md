- Learning outcomes
	- Describe intermolecular forces in solids
	- Relate the intermolecular forces in crystalline solids to the crystal lattice energy
	- Draw and use a Born-Haber cycle
- Classification
	- Crystalline solids
		- Atoms, ions, and molecules that have highly ordered structures
	- Amorphous solids
		- Particles that are randomly arranged with no discernible pattern
- Major types of crystalline solids
	- Ionic solids
		- Positive and negative ions held together by electrostatic attractions
		- Ionic bonds
		- Hard, brittle
		- Conducts as liquid, not as solid
		- High to very high MP
		- Ex. NaCl
	- Metallic solids
		- Uniform distribution of atomic nuclei within a "sea" of delocalized electrons
		- Metallic bonds
		- Shiny, malleable, ductile
		- Conducts heat and electricy
		- Variable hardness and MP
		- Ex. Cu, Fe, Ti, Pb
	- Covalent network solids
		- Atoms held together by a network of covalent bonds
		- Covalent bonds
		- Very hard
		- Not conductive
		- Very high MP
		- Ex. Diamond (C), $SiO_2$ 
	- Molecular solids
		- Discrete molecules held together by attractive forces
		- IMFs
		- Variable hardness, variable brittleness
		- Not conductive
		- Low MP
		- Ex. $H_2 O$, $CO_2$ 
- Calculating Crystal Lattice Energies
	- Formation reactions
		- Starting materials must be neutral and in standard states
		- $\Delta \text{H} \textdegree_{f}$ 
	- Born-Haber Cycle
		1. Write down 1 mole of the product
			- 1 mol NaCl (s)
		2. Write down each element in it
			- Na + Cl -> 1 mol NaCl (s)
		3. Write their standard states
			- Na (s) + $\text{Cl}_2$ (g) -> NaCl (s)
		4. Balance
			- Na (s) + $\frac{1}{2} \text{Cl}_2$ (g) -> NaCl (s)
	- Example:
		- 1 mol $Mn_2O_3 (s)$ 
		- Mn (s) + $O_2$ (g) -> $Mn_2O_3 (s)$ 
		- 2 Mn (s) + $\frac{3}{2} O_2$ (g) -> $Mn_2O_3$ (s)
	- Using formation reactions to predict crystal lattice energies
		- Write down the compound you're interested in the lower right hand corner of your working space
		- Show the formation reaction leading to t along the bottom of your working space
		- Show the crystal lattice reaction leading to it down the right hand side of your working space
