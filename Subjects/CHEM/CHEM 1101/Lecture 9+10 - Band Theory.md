- Properties of Metals
	- Metals are malleable
	- Metals are ductile (drawn to wires)
	- Metals conduct electricity and heat
- Band Theory
	- Description of bonding in solids using delocalized orbitals
	- Example: Li atoms coming together into a cluster one at a time
		- Develops the idea of "bands"
		- All electrons are on the bonding side of the MO diagram. As more Li is added you continue to add to the bonding side.
		- Creates a "gap" between the bonding and anti-bonding side.
		- For solids, the number of atoms is very large which makes the MO energies form an effectively continuous band.
			- Has empty part for anti-bonding side
			- Has full part for bonding side
			- No band "gap"!
			- Allows free movement across physical space and to conduct charge
				- As an electron moves to the empty part, it creates a "hole" which can then be filled.
	- H.O.M.O
		- Highest occupied MO
		- Closest part of the full section to the empty section
	- L.U.M.O
		- Lowest unoccupied MO
		- Closest part of the empty section to the full section
	- Valence band
		- Highest energy orbital with at least one electron
	- Conduction band
		- Lowest energy orbital with at least one hole
	- For Li, since there is only the S band, it is both the valence and conduction band
	- Valence and conduction bands are affected by a potential difference
		- Bands close to the negative plate are destabilised through repulsion
		- Bands closer to the positive plate are stabilised through attraction
		- Electrons flow through the metals from the neg to the pos end
			- Current
	- Insulator
		- No charge transfer
		- $E_G$ > 5 eV
	- Semiconductor
		- Sometimes a charge transfer
		- $E_G$ = 1 eV
	- Metal
		- Always a charge transfer
		- No band gap
