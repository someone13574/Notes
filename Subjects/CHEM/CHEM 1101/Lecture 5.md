- Rules for naming compounds depending on the type of compound
	- Ionic
		- Monatomic ions
			- One atom
		- Polyatomic ions
			- Multiple atoms
			- Eg. OH-, NH4+
	- Covalent

- Ionic Compunds
	- Metal cation and nonmetal anion
		- Or any combination of molecular or elemental icons
	- To be stable, must be neutral
	- Ions combine to form lattice
	- Eg. Sodium Chloride
	- Binary ionic compounds
		- Only contain monatomic icons
		- Naming
			1. Name the cation (metal) first, then the anion (non-metal)
			2. Name the anion by replacing its ending with the suffix -ide.
			3. For transition metals with multiple possible charges, write the charge in roman numbers after the name of the metal
			- Eg.
				- Potassium bromide
				- Calcium chloride
				- Aluminum oxide
				- Chromium (III) iodide
				- Iron (II) iodide
	- Compounds containing polyatomic ions
		- Named similarly to binary ionic compounds
		- No need to change to -ide ending. Suffix already present in name.
		- Eg. Potassium acetate, Sodium Bicarbonate, Magnesium phosphate, Aluminum carbonate

- Covalent Compounds
	- Atoms bonded covalently form individual, discrete assemblies called molecules
	- Some compounds have common names
		- H2O = water
		- NH3 = ammonia
	- Naming
		1. Name the lower group number of lower electronegative element first, using its element name unchanged
		2. Name the second element using the suffix -ide
		3. Add greek prefixes to indicate the numbers of each element in the compounds
			1. Mono
			2. Di
			3. Tri
			4. Tetra/Tetr
			5. Penta/Pent
			6. Hexa/Hex
			7. Hepta/Hept
			8. Octa/Oct
			9. Nona/Non
			10. Deca/Dec
