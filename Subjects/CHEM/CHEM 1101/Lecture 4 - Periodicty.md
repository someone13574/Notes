- Elements in the same group have the same valence electron configuration
- Elements with the same valence electron configuration show similar chemical behavior
- Electron configurations can be used to explain periodic trends
- Across a row left to right:
	- Number of shells stays the same.
	- Atomic number increases
	- Positive charge in the nucleus increases, pulling the outer valence electrons closer
		- Reduces size
		- More stable
- Down a column in the periodic table
	- Number of shells increase (n)
		- Dominating factor determining orbital size and stability
	- Atomic number increases (Z)
	- Becomes larger as valence electrons occupy levels further from the nucleus
	- Valence orbitals get larger and less stable
- Bottom right has largest atomic radius, top left has smallest
	- Increases down because valence orbitals become larger
	- Decreases right because nucleus becomes stronger with higher atomic numbers.


- Ionization Energy
	- Down
		- Ionization energy decreases
		- n increasing moves electrons further out which makes them easier to remove
	- Left
		- As atomic number increases, attraction between the nucleus and valence electrons increases
		- More energy is required to remove
	- Opposite of atomic size because closer electrons are held onto stronger
	- Exceptions
		- Lithium is easy to ionize because removing one electron makes valance subshell complete (stable).
		- Beryllium is hard to ionize because it takes a full s shell and makes it not full.
		- Boron is easy to ionize because it removes the partial p subshell.
		- Oxygen is easy to ionize because is makes the valance shell half full.

- Electron Affinity
	- The energy change when an electron is added to the atom
	- Reverse principal of Ionization Energy but follows the same trend
		- Moving down decreases electron affinity
			- As the shell increases, the distance to the nucleus increases. Less attraction for incoming electrons.
		- Moving right increases electron affinity
			- As the atomic number increases, the nucleus size increases and pulls in electrons more. Stronger attraction.

	- Electronegativity
		- Tendency of an atom to pull electrons in a **bond** towards itself.
		- A bond between a low EN atom and a high EN atom will move the electrons more around the high EN atom.
		- Increases Right
		- Decreases Down

- Forming ions
	- Move electrons onto or off the atom to
		- Fill the valence s and p subshells
		- Empty the entire valence s and p subshells
		- Empty the valence p subshell **only** if $n \geq 4$.
		- **NEVER** add more than 3 electrons
		- **NEVER** more than 3 electrons for $n \leq 3$ or 4 electrons for $n \geq 4$
		- Metals **NEVER** form *negative* ions

- Writing electron configuration for Ions
	1.  Write configuration for neutral atom & count the number of electrons
	2. If ion is negative, add electrons until ion’s negative charge is reached
	3. If ion is positive, remove electrons until positive charge reached
	4. Fill orbitals to match the nearest noble gas of smaller atomic number
	5. Add remaining electrons to the next filling orbitals according to Hund’s rule
		- For neutral atoms and anions, place electrons in ns before (n-1)d
		- For cations, place electrons in (n-1)d before ns
