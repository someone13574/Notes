---

- Elements in the same group have the same valence electron configuration
- Elements with the same valence electron configuration show similar chemical behavior
- Electron configurations can be used to explain periodic trends
- Across a row left to right:
	- Number of shells stays the same.
	- Atomic number increases
	- Positive charge in the nucleus increases, pulling the outer valence electrons closer
		- Reduces size
		- More stable
- Down a column in the periodic table
	- Number of shells increase (n)
		- Dominating factor determining orbital size and stability
	- Atomic number increases (Z)
	- Becomes larger as valence electrons occupy levels further from the nucleus
	- Valence orbitals get larger and less stable
- Bottom right has largest atomic radius, top left has smallest
	- Increases down because valence orbitals become larger
	- Decreases right because nucleus becomes stronger with higher atomic numbers.


- Ionization Energy
	- Down
		- Ionization energy decreases
		- n increasing moves electrons further out which makes them easier to remove
	- Left
		- As atomic number increases, attraction between the nucleus and valence electrons increases
		- More energy is required to remove
	- Opposite of atomic size because closer electrons are held onto stronger
