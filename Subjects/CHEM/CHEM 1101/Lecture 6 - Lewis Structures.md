- Lewis Electron-Dot Symbols
	- Convenient representations of valence electrons
	- Consists of the chemical symbol for the element plus a dot for each valence electron
	- 2 electrons per side, 4 sides
- Drawing
	1. Place atom with lowest electronegativity in the center
	2. Total valence electrons
	3. Draw single bonds to central atom and subtract $2e^{-1}$ for each bond
	4. Give each atom $8e^{-1}$ ($2e^{-1}$ for H)

- Sometimes the central atom isn't clear
	- We need to calculate the formal charge
	- FC = # valence e - (# unshared valence e + 1/2 shared valence e)
		- Simpler: RC = # valence e - # actual e

- Lewis structures for ions
	- Cations (positive)
		- Subtract
	- Anions (negative)
		- Add
	- To determine which atom(s) hold the charge(s), we can calculate formal charge for each atom

- Multiple bonds can be used if there are not enough electrons to attain octets.
- Oxygen, Carbon, and Nitrogen often form multiple bonds
- Use formal charges to place multiple bonds
	- Can create resonance structures if two representations are "optimal"
	- "Resonates" between the two optimal representations
	- Both bonds are identical in length and energy
	- Bond order of a bond for resonance
		- Average over all representations

## Octet Rule Exceptions

- Electron deicient atoms (Be, B, Al)
	- Depends of EN of atoms bonded to
- Odd electron atoms
	- Free radicals (NO2, NO)
- Expanded valence shells
	- Non-metals from row 3 or higher (has d orbitals)
	- Eg. SO2
