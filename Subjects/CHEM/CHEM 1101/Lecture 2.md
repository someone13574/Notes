A photon of wavelength 1,089 nm is emitted when an electron in hydrogen makes a transition to the third level.  Determine the level that the electron started in.[[Subjects/CHEM/CHEM 1101/media/L2/Class 2- atoms and light.pdf|Class 2- atoms and light]]

### Sig-figs of Logarithms

- The number of **decimal places** in the the calculated value is equal to the number of sig figs in the original value.
- The number of sig-figs after the decimal place represents the total number of sig figs in the calculated result.

$ln(2.634 \times 10^{-19}) = -42.7806$

$log_{10}(x) = -8.000$
$x = 1.0 \times 10^8$

# Atoms

- All atoms are comprised of a dense nucleus filled with neutrons ($n^0$) and protons ($p^+$), surrounded by a cloud of electrons ($e^-$)

### Rutherford Experiment

Rutherford’s experiment elucidated the core structure of the atom. When a gold sheet is bombarded with a beam of charged alpha particles, some pass through, some are deflected, and some are fully reflected.

Because the alpha particle is positively charged, the interpretation is that there is a large cluster of positive charge at the centre of an atom: a nucleus.

### The Atomic Symbol

The number of protons determines the element.

### Isotopes

Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different masses. There are three isotopes of carbon found naturally, but only two are found in any significant amount.

# Rydberg and Photoelectric effect

- Relate the electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed to transitions between levels in the hydrogen atom.
- Determine work functions and ionization energies given wavelength data from electromagnetic radiation and vice versa.

### Light-Matter Interactions

- Some atmospheric components interact with radiation.
- These interactions result in energy exchanges that affects Earth's temperature.
- Earth’s atmosphere normally traps 84% of the solar energy re-emitted by the planet’s surface. This phenomenon is called “greenhouse effect” and helps to keep an average temperature of 15 C.
	- Without this, Earth would be below freezing.
	- This effect is getting stronger.

### Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR)

- Light has two properties
	- Wave-like
	- Particle-like
	- Modelling EMR as waves or particles is an oversimplification, but for our purposes be can think of EMR as being made up of particles.
- *Photons* are a "particle" of light, whose energy depends on the frequency of the radiation.
- $c = \text{velocity of light} = 2.998 \times 10^8 \text{m/s}$
	- $c = v \lambda$

##### The Photoelectric Effect

- Phenomenon shows how the energy of light depends on its frequency and intensity
- When a beam of photons strikes a collection of atoms, electrons are emitted from the atoms.
	- The photoelectric effect involves the collision of ONE photon with ONE electron.
	- The intensity of the light must be great enough that the energy overcomes the binding energy of the electron.
		- Each element has their own threshold frequency where no electrons will be released below that point.

### $E_{photon} = h \cdot v_{photon} = \frac{h \cdot c}{\lambda}$

- h = Planck's constant = $6.6262 \times 10^{-34} J\cdot s$

### Work function vs. Binding energy

- $\phi$ = work function = minimum energy required to remove an electron from a metal surface.
- Every electron has a binding energy whether it is a discrete atom, molecule, or material. The work function is the smallest binding energu for an atom, molecule, or material.

## Applications with gases: Reactions in the Ozone layer

- $O_3$ absorbds most UV-B light and UV-C light, which is harmful to living organisms.
- Depletions of $O_3$ molecules prevents absorption of harmful radiation that can increase death rates for almost all living species.

## EMR

- Atoms can absorb and emit photons
- Photon absorption by the atom increases the energy of the outermost electron (absorbs energy to move to the higher energy states)
- When this electron returns to its origin energy, it can release a photon (releases energy to fall to lower energy states
- Each atom has its own, unique, emission spectrum. The *visible* lines are called the Balmer series.
	- The opposite of this spectrum is the absorption spectrum. The missing frequencies are where the light is absorbed.
- ![[Pasted image 20240916084916.png]]
- Bohr was the first to connect line spectra of atoms and the idea of quantized energy.
	- He proposed the orbit model for the atom where electron orbits cannot take any value; instead they are "quantified" to only certain orbits, defined by the whole number n.
	- While in an orbit, an electron neither absorbs nor emits radiation.
- The energy of an orbit is given by the Rydberg Equation
##### $E_{\text{gap/photon}} = R_H(1/n_i^2 - 1/n_f^2)$ 

- $R_H$ = Rydberg constant: $2.18 \times 10^{-18} J$
- $n_i$: initial orbit
- $n_f$: final orbit
- Positive E: Absorbed photon
- Negative E: Emitted photon
