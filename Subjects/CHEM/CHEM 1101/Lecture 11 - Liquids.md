Learning outcomes:
- Predict relative magnitudes of inter molecular forces and their effects on physical properties
- Describe inter-molecular foces in liquids and relate them to heat of vaporization
- Calculate the vapour pressure or boiling point of a liquid

- The state of a substance depends on the balance between kinetic energy of the individual particles and the inter-molecular forces
	- Heating and cooling change the kinetic energy
		- Changes the physical state of a substance
	- Increasing the pressure on a substance forces molecules closer together which increases the strength of inter-molecular forces
- Liquids
	- Inter-molecular attractive forces are strong enough to hold molecules close together
	- Liquids are more dense and less compressible than gases
	- Liquids have a definite volume, indepenent of the size and shape of the container
	- The forces are not strong enough to keep neighboring molecules in a fixed position
- Understanding properties of liquids leads to discoveries
	- Biomimcry models that strategies used by living organisms to solve complex challeneges
		- Ex. Gore-Tax is breathable and waterproof
- Intra-molecular forces
	- Forces within molecules
	- Include *chemical* properties
	- Example: Formation of ${NH}_3$ from $N_2$ and $H_2$  
- Inter-molecular forces
	- Forces **between** molecules
		- Hydrogen bonding
		- Dipole-dipole
	- Influence *physical properties*
	- Examples:
		- Condensation of water vapor
		- Sugar dissolving in water
		- Water flowing up veins of a plant due to capillary action.
- Types of inter-molecular forces
	- (ion-ion is intra-molecular)
	- Ion-Dipole
	- Hydrogen bond (not a bond)
	- Dipole-dipole
	- Ion-induced dipole
	- Dipole-induced dipole
	- Disperion (London)
- We are most interested in the strongest force
- Boiling point
	- Temperature at which the average kinetic energy of a molecular motion overcomes energy of inter-molecular forces
- Types of forces
	- Dispersion
		- Weakest: .1 - 5 kJ/mol
			- Increases in strength with increasing electron count
		- Exists in all molecules
		- Generated by induced charge imbalances
		- Examples: F - F, all halogen gases
		- Factors affecting
			- Mass
				- Increasing mass increases BP
			- Shape
				- Increasing surface area decreases BP
				- Long = high BP
			- Mass more important than surface area
	- Ion-/Dipole- Induced Dipole force
		- 4th strongest force: interactions between polar modules and non-polar molecules
			- 2-10 kJ/mol for dipole-induced dipole
			- 4-15 kJ/mol for ion-induced dipole
		- Strength depends on strength of dipole/ion
		- Ion example:
			- $\text{Ca}^{+2} - O_2$ 
		- Dipole example:
			- HCl - $\text{Cl}_2$ 
	- Dipole-dipole
		- 3rd strongest force
			- 5-25 kJ/mol
		- Between two polar molecules
		- Why is 2-methyl propane a gas and acetone a liquid at room temp?
			- Acetone has dipole-dipole and therefore needs more energy to overcome intermolecular forces than is provided from room temperature. 2-methyl propane doesn't have dipole-dipole and therefore doesn't need as much energy.
		- Example: HCl - HCl
	- Hydrogen Bond
		- 2nd strongest force
			- 5-50 kJ/mol
		- Occurs when hydrogen is directly bonded to F, O, or N
		- Is a type of dipole-dipole interaction
		- Examples
			- $H - \text{NH}_3$ 
			- $\text{H - H}_2\text{O}$ 
			- H - HF
	- Ion-dipole force
		- Strongest force
			- 40 - 600 kJ/mol
		- Between an ion and a permanent dipole
		- Positive ends of polar molecules orient towards anions
		- Negative ends of polar molecules orient towards cations.
	- Examples:
		- $\text{ClF}_3$ = dipole-dipole
		- $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ = hydrogen bonding
		- $\text{CO}_2$ = dispersion

- Other physical properties
	- Cohesion
		- Attraction of molecules in liquid to one another
		- Attraction between like molecules
	- Adhesion
		- Attraction of molecules in the liquid to the molecules of the container
		- Attraction between unlike molecules
		- Example: Capillary action
			- Upwards movement of a liquids in a narrow tube against gravity
			- Adhesion with walls of plant
			- Cohesion pulls water molecules up with them
	- Example: Surface tension
		- Measures the resistance of a liquid due to the cohesive forces between molecules
		- There is a net inward forces on the molecules which causes a droplet to form.
			- Higher inter-molecular forces have high surface tensions
	- Vapour pressure
		- Pressure exerted above the oquid by it vapour in a closed system
		- The number of molecules of liquid that have energy energy to escape into gas depends on temperature and strength of intermolecular forces
		- Stronger IMF -> prevents vaporization -> lower VP
		- Lower IMF -> allows vaporization -> higher VP
		- Example
			- R = gas constant = 8.314 J/K mol = 0.08206 L atm/K mol
			- What is the vapour pressure of acetic acid at 23c, given that its NBP is 117.9c and $\Delta H_{vap} = 39.1 kJ/mol$ 
			- $\ln(\frac{P_2}{P_1}) = \frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R}(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1})$  
			- $P_1$ = 1 atm (NBP)
			- $T_1$ = 117.9c + 273c = 398.9 K (NBP)
			- $\ln(\frac{P_2}{P_1}) = \frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R}(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1})$  
			- $\ln(\frac{P_2}{1\ atm}) = \frac{39.1 \times 10^{3} J/mol}{8.314 J/K mol}(\frac{1}{296 K} - \frac{1}{390.9 K})$  
			- $\ln(\frac{P_2}{1\ atm}) = (4.1029 \times 10^3 K)(-8.20179 \times 10^{-4} K^{-1})$ 
			- $\ln(\frac{P_2}{1\ atm}) = -3.85123$ 
			- $\frac{P_2}{1\ atm} = e^{-3.85123}$ 
		- Example
			- At what temperature does water boil at the summit of Mount Everest, where the atmospheric pressure is 0.35 atm? $\Delta H_{vap} = 43.4 kJ/mol = 43.4 \times 10^3 J/mol$ 
			- $P_1 = 1\ atm$ (NBP) 
			- $T_1 = 100c$ (NBP) = 373 K
			- $P_2 = 0.35\ atm$ 
			- $\ln(\frac{P_2}{P_1}) = \frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R}(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1})$ 
			- $\ln(\frac{0.35\ atm}{1\ atm}) = \frac{43.4 \times 10^3 J/mol}{8.314 J/K mol}(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{373 K})$   
			- $-1.049822 = (5.220110 K)(\frac{1}{T_2} - 2.68096 K^{-1})$  
			- $-2.01111 \times 10^{-3} K^{-1} = \frac{1}{T_2} - 2.68096 K^{-1}$ 
			- $T_2 = \frac{1}{2.83276 K^{-1}}$
