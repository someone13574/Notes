### VSEPR: Valence Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion

- Prodict shapes of modules in 3D
- Each group of valence electrons around a central atom is located as far as possible from the others, to minimize repulsions.
- An electron pair or group: electrons that occupy a localized region in a molecule.
- A ligand or outer atom: an atom or group of atoms bonded to an inner atom
- Steric number
	- Number of ligands plus number of lone pairs
	- Total number of electron groups associated with an atom
	- To determine the steric number, you need to draw the Lewis structure.

- Electron pair geometries can differ from ideality, giving rise to differences in bond angles from those predicted from the ideal shapes.
	- Electron groups with higher electron density will repel other groups more
	- This pushes them further away from other groups
	- This causes lower electron density groups to be closer to each other
	- LP----LP > LP----BP > BP----BP
- Axial position
	- Up and down
	- Makes a line
- Equatorial position
	- Sides
	- More space
	- Lone pairs go here
		- Except in octahedral

## Molecular Polarity

- To predict whether a specific molecule is polar or non-polar, you must consider two characteristics
	1. Types of bonds in the molecule
	2. Geometric shape of the molecule
- Bonds are polar if
	- Bonded atoms have different electronegativites
- Molecules are polar if
	- They contain one or more polar bonds
	- The individual bond dipoles do not cancel, creating a net dipole.
		- Depends on molecular shape
- How polar is a molecule
	- Dipole moment
		- Larger = more polar
		- Unit debye (D)
			- 1 Debye = $3.34\times 10^{-30} C\ cm$ 
	- $\micro =qr$ 
		- radius r, charge q
	- Does not need to be calculated
- Polar versus nonpolar molecules
	- Water has a bent molecular structure and polar bonds between O and H.
		- The dipoles add together to give the water molecule a net dipole

			- X components cancel
			- Y components add
	- Carbon dioxide has polar bonds but the linear structure causes them to cancel
