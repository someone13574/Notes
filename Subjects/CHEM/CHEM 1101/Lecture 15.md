[[Class 15- stoichiometry1.pdf]]

---

- Learning Outcomes
	- Describe rules of conservation in reactions
	- Predict relative amounts of reagents consumed and leftover
	- Carry out stoichiometry calculations with limited reagents
- Mole: defined by the number of atoms in 12 g of pure 12C
- Avogadro's number = $N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23}$ units in one mole
- Molar mass = the mass of 1 mole of that substance
- Mole method:
	- Use molar mass to go from mass to moles
	- Use stoichiometric ratios to go from reactants to products
	- Use moles of product to find mass of product
