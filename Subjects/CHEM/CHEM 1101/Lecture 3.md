### Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom

- Schrodinger proposed a new way to think of the structure of the atom
- Mathematically treat $e^-$ as waves
- Wave equation
- Only certain frequencies and energies are allowed (quantized)
- Non-integer number of waves will destructively interfere.


### Orbitals
- 3D waves of bound electrons determined by the Schrodinger equation
- Give densities and probabilities, not exact locations
- Have size, shape, tilt, and energy determined by quantum numbers.


##### Quantum Numbers

| Symbol | Name             | Describes                             | Area     | Allowed values                          |
| :----- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| n      | Principle        | Energy and Avg. Size                  | Shell    | n=1, 2, 3, $\infty$. Ex: 1s, 2s, 3s     |
| l      | Angular momentum | Shape of area                         | Subshell | l = 0, 1, 2, ..., (n-1). Ex: s, p, d, f |
| $m_l$  | Magnetic         | Tilt/orientation of area              | Oribital | -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. $p_x, p_y, p_z$    |
| $m_s$  | Spin             | Direction of spin relative to nucleus |          | +1/2 or -1/2                            |

- Max number of orbitals: `num_orbitials = 2l + 1`
- Max electrons: `num_e = 4l + 2`

- As nuclear charge increases, orbital energy decreases.
- As $l$ increases, energy increases due to electron repulsion.

## Filling Oribitals

1. Pauli Exclusion Principle
	- No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of 4 quantum numbers. (max two electrons per orbital)
2. Aufbau Principle
	- Place electrons in oribitals with the lowest energy orbital first
	- Fill lowest to highest
3. Hund's Rule
	- Fill orbitals with the same energy one electron at a time with parallel spins.

### Valence Shells

- Valence Shell
	- The shell that is furthest from the nucleus on average
	- Must have at least one electron in it
	- It is the largest n value
	- Example: upside down v=6 in Os example
- Valence Subshells
	- Any and all subshells of the valence shell
	- Each must have at least one electron
	- Example: 6s only in Os example
- Highest energy subshell
	- Last subshell in the electron configuration
	- Doesn't need to be in the valence shell
	- Last thing written in the configuation
	- Follows Afbau
	- Example: 5d in Os example.

## Exceptions to Aufbau

- s2d4 metals tend to adopt s1d5 configuration
- s2d9 metals tend to adopt s1d10
- s2f1 tend to adopt s1d1
